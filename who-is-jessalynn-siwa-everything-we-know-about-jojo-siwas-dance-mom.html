As the<a href=#> unconditional supporter </a>of her daughter's career, Jessalynn has pushed JoJo forward and has continued encouraging her to chase her dreams, doing everything in her power to help her little girl achieve the highest level of success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's been so busy selflessly taking care of all of JoJo's needs, that the world hasn't heard much about Jessalynn Siwa's personal life... here's what we've learned about this infamous Dance Mom.</p><h2 id=she-comes-from-humble-beginnings><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Comes From Humble Beginnings</span></h2><p>Jessalynn Siwa has a current net worth of $2 million, and her guidance, support, and coaching, has led her daughter, JoJo Siwa to a staggering $20 million net worth. Money certainly is not an issue for the Siwa family these days, but that was not always the case. Jessalyn came from humble beginnings and has worked her way to the top. She was born on the 8th of December in 1974 to a mother that was a hair stylist and a father that worked at a waste manufacturing organization.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>JoJo Siwa Dishes The Dirt On Her Coming Out Story And A New Reality Show</a></span></p><h2 id=jessalynn-siwa-owns-a-dance-studio><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jessalynn Siwa Owns A Dance Studio</span></h2><p>According to The Netline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessalynn enjoyed a very successful artistic career as a talented dancer</a> and went on to teach her skills to the younger generation by becoming a dance instructor. As she progressed through the arts world, she worked hard to open the Underground Dance Factory, her very own dance studio. She kept busy and was a multi-tasker when it came to anything to do with dance. She also ran the Just Dance Co. and lent her skills to teaching proper dance technique to eager children that shared the same passion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-a-keen-eye-for-talent><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Has A Keen Eye For Talent</span></h2><p>Jessalynn spent much of her life heavily immersed in the dance scene, and as she honed in on her talent, she developed a very keen eye for talent in the industry. She had no idea that her daughter would end up following in her footsteps, but it wasn't long before she started to see the beginnings of true talent oozing out of JoJo's performance skills. Jessalynn told Time that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JoJo's skills were obvious from the time she was just a year and a half old. </a>She said, “She just liked being onstage, and everyone liked to watch her.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How JoJo Siwa Has Become Even More Successful Than Her 'Dance Moms' Co-Star, Maddie Ziegler</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessalynn-siwa-is-definitely-not-a-stage-mom><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jessalynn Siwa Is Definitely Not A Stage Mom</span></h2><p>After seeing Jessalynn Siwa on Dance Moms, most people assume that she fits the same profile as most of the other moms who aggressively seek fame and fortune by pushing their children to perform. Presuming her to be a selfish stage mom would be doing a severe injustice to Jessalynn, who is actually quite the opposite. Her focus hasn't been to launch JoJo to fame, it has been to encourage her to do her best and follow the passion that inspires her heart.</p><p>JoJo tells The Netline, “She is not a stage mom. A lot of people think that my mom is crazy, and a lot people think that she’s like, ‘Oh you have to make a YouTube video and you have to perform good.’ [She’s] literally the most opposite of that. She’s like, ‘JoJo, turn your computer off and stop working.’ Her thing is that she just wants me to be happy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessalynn-sacrificed-her-career-for-jojo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jessalynn Sacrificed Her Career For JoJo</span></h2><p>As JoJo Siwa's popularity really began to soar, and she saw success beyond the realm of dance, in the social media realm, it quickly became apparent that her parents had to make lifestyle changes in order to support her increasingly busy schedule.</p><p>JoJo's father was a successful chiropractor, and he gave up his career to help on the back end of JoJo's affairs. Jessalynn gave up her career as well, and she has selflessly worked to promote JoJo's career and manage her business affairs. She has now devoted her life to the success of her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-39-s-a-dog-person><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She's A Dog Person</span></h2><p>Jessalynn Siwa loves animals, but more than any other furry, fuzzy creature, she claims dogs as being her number one favorite. She's definitely a dog person, and that shows through the fact that she owns three dogs that she absolutely adores. The dogs aren't treated like pets at all, they're very much members of the family, and she dotes on them at every opportunity. The newest member to her canine family, is a tiny teacup Yorkie named BowBow.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>JoJo Siwa Reveals The Hardest Part About Dancing With Another Girl</a></span></p><h2 id=she-oversees-jojo-39-s-schedule><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Oversees JoJo's Schedule</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>JoJo Siwa may only be 18 years old, but her schedule is already more hectic than most adults twice her age. She has a series of different business responsibilities to handle, and of course, she's so busy being at the heart of this lifestyle that she needs someone to manage her schedule and help her along the way. Her mom, Jessalynn, is that person.</p><p>Jessalynn admits that managing all of JoJo's appearances, performances, and business deals is a very tough gig. She told USA Today that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">managing JoJo has been very overwhelming at times</a>, and the pressure to find the balance between JoJo's career and their personal lives together has been very tough. However, she takes a lot of pride in her role and says, "Every day is just a learning experience… It’s a lot of work and a lot of commitment. If it’s what you love, you’ve gotta try.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessalynn-siwa-has-her-own-podcast><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jessalynn Siwa Has Her Own Podcast</span></h2><p>Jessalynn has really come a long way since the days of being a passionate dancer and then becoming a mom.

She has come a very long way, and there's no stopping her now!</p><p>Jessalynn Siwa has continued to expand on her success and maximize on her public exposure by launching her very own podcast.
