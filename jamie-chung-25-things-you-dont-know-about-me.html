Then — the very last minute you can — do strips of meat or you can do your shrimp. As it’s boiling, you can serve it right in the middle of the table. Everyone has their own little bowl.”</p><p>She likes to embrace her roots in the kitchen and on screen. Chung, who is married to<a href=#><strong> Bryan Greenberg</strong></a>, said that her favorite role ever was on HBO’s Emmy-nominated series Lovecraft Country as Ji-Ah.</p><p>“I was so terrified of speaking Korean, and it’s an identity that I always fought when I was much younger, you know, because I wanted to assimilate and be like everyone else,” the San Francisco native explained. “I’m particularly proud of that role because I really got to do everything. I got to get over a lot of my fears, which is speaking Korean in a role, singing in a role, dancing in a role — I really had to do it all. So that’s kind of the peak.”</p><p>A year after playing her favorite character yet, she took on <a href=#>a new role in real life: mom</a>. Chung and the<a href=#> One Tree Hill </a>alum, who married in 2015, <a href=#>welcomed twin boys</a> via surrogate in October 2021.</p><p>“They’re just starting solid foods, and it’s so fun watching them explore,” she gushed while promoting her partnership with <a href=#>Huggies’ Baby Academy for Pups</a>. “They’re really taking everything in. … It’s so fun to see them react to new things, whether it’s new tastes, new sounds, new visions, a swing. It’s been a really fun delight to kind of rediscover all of these things with them.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Chung:</p><p>1.
