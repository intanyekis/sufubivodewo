He attended Purdue University and graduated with a degree in Psychology before going on to earn an MA in Journalism from New York University’s Science And Environmental Reporting Program.</p><p>Ted Allen is a television personality, chef, writer, and author of cookbooks such as ‘The Food You Want To Eat:100 Smart and ‘Simple Recipes.’ He has also appeared in films such as Uncorked! : Wine Made Simple: Vol. 1, Uncorked! : Wine Made Simple: Vol. 2, and Uncorked! : Wine Made Simple: Vol. 3.</p><p>He has appeared on TV shows such as ‘Queer Eye For Straight Guy,’ ‘The Best Thing I Ever Ate,’ and ‘Chopped,’ increasing his net worth to $5 million.</p><p>Rice is an interior designer who creates modern interiors with a focus on custom-made furnishings. He opened Full Circle Modern, which includes vintage furniture designs, in 2013.</p><p>The couple has been legally married for three years. The couple is currently residing in New York. It appears that they are quite supportive of one another, which has resulted in their relationship being this strong and able to stretch this far. We wish them a long and healthy relationship.</p><h2><span id=The_Journey_of_a_Famous_Gay_Couple_Towards_Marriage>The Journey of a Famous Gay Couple Towards Marriage:</span></h2><p>It was the same for every gay couple who had been waiting for the legalization of same-sex marriage. The same was true for Ted and his wife Rice.</p><p>Ted, an openly gay journalist, has stated how long he has been waiting for the day when couples will be treated equally (i.e. both straight and gay couples).</p><p>After a two-decade relationship, the couple was unsure whether their relationship would progress to marriage. They were waiting for the law to allow them to live together legally. Finally, news arrived that put an end to this couple’s wait. In 2013, the Supreme Court finally approved gay marriage. There was no doubt about their eagerness for that specific day and the joy brought by that announcement, which Ted Allen demonstrated by tweeting.</p><p>On which he received several concerning responses, one of which was from Mario Batali, who responded to Ted’s tweet. According to the article he mentioned on The Huffington Post,</p><p>“We talked about it for years.”</p><p>He went on to say,</p><p>“As wonderful as it is for states to legalize marriage, we’ve always wanted to see the real thing, when it was genuinely recognized by the federal government of the greatest country on the planet.”</p><p>He gathered,</p><p>“I don’t think our movement is finished, that our work is done,’ but this was a huge hurdle.”</p><p>He laughed and added,</p><p>“Sir, DOMA has been chopped.”</p><p>Ted Allen Rice, the host of the popular food show ‘chopped,’ announced his engagement on June 26, 2016, and later married his longtime love, interior designer Barry Rice, on July 30, 2013. Regardless, love found its way.</p><p>Ted’s love and care for Rice can be seen in his tweets, which show how happy they are moving forward in their marriage.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Erica Lindbeck</a>, <a href=#>Johnny Fratto</a>, and <a href=#>Jaye Sousoures</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Author</a> <a href=# rel=tag>chef</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Television Personality</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Fred Armisen Discovers the Surprising Truth About His Parents</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Learn Everything There Is To Know About Jaycee Lee Dugard’s Past, Family, And Relationship.</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqbKlecClo56mXZa7brvPnqWlsV2crrp51qugrZ2iYrWiv4yaZJukmajAp8HLZqSaqqKesqV5y6KdnmWnnsGpeceiqmakn6O0tbXMnmSpmaKpu6a%2BjK2sq6aVmXqpwdKbmKecXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fted-allen-an-openly-gay-writer-has-a-blissful-married-life-with-his-longtime-partner-turned-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fted-allen-an-openly-gay-writer-has-a-blissful-married-life-with-his-longtime-partner-turned-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fted-allen-an-openly-gay-writer-has-a-blissful-married-life-with-his-longtime-partner-turned-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fted-allen-an-openly-gay-writer-has-a-blissful-married-life-with-his-longtime-partner-turned-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fted-allen-an-openly-gay-writer-has-a-blissful-married-life-with-his-longtime-partner-turned-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fted-allen-an-openly-gay-writer-has-a-blissful-married-life-with-his-longtime-partner-turned-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-el-milagrito-by-marco-antonio-solis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-el-milagrito-by-marco-antonio-solis.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: El milagrito by Marco Antonio Sols</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pippa-middleton-kate-middleton-royal-wedding-hair.html>Pippa Middleton's Royal Wedding Hair How You Can Create Her Flowing Look!
