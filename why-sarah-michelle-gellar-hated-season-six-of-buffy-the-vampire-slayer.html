In fact, Gellar has even stated that season 6 of the show is her least favorite, and she had some valid criticism for the season.</p><p>Let's learn why Sarah Michelle Gellar is not a fan of season 6 of Buffy.</p><h2 id=39-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-39-was-a-tremendous-show>'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' Was A Tremendous Show</h2><p>In 1997, Buffy the Vampire Slayer made its debut on UPN, and people didn't know what to expect from the show. It was based on the 1992 movie of the same name, and that film was by no means a huge success. Despite this, the TV series hit the ground running and never looked back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring is Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead role, Buffy lasted for seven seasons and nearly 145 episodes, and to this day, it is considered one of the best and most loved shows of its era.</p><p>Earlier this year, Gellar reflected on the 25-year anniversary of the hit show, writing, "25 years ago today I had the honor to introduce the world to my version of Buffy Anne Summers. It was an uphill battle. A mid season replacement, on a new network based on a movie, that was by no means a giant success. But then there was you. The fans. You believed in us. You made this happen. You are the reason 25 years later we are still celebrating. So today we celebrate you as well. <a href=#>#wwbd</a>."</p><p>Gellar clearly has a love and appreciation for the show, but there is one season that she is not too fond of.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Buffy The Vampire Slayer’ Actor, James Marsters Worth Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-michelle-gellar-hated-season-6>Sarah Michelle Gellar Hated Season 6</h2><p>Several years ago, in 2017, Sarah Michelle Gellar opened up about the show, and she pinpointed season six as her least favorite.</p><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up about why</a>, Gellar said, "I’ve always said that season 6 was not my favorite. I felt it betrayed who she was. Even just getting to talk to Joss and be able to get his opinion was not as easy when he’s not upstairs. He had three shows. He had Angel and Firefly so that was hard. But he made sure to dedicate the time to season 7 and that was his promise to me: that we would right all the wrongs and he kept that promise."</p><p>Interestingly, the aforementioned Joss Whedon had no issues with season six. In fact, he felt quite the opposite about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I love season six. [Producer] Marti Noxon and I wanted to talk about an unhealthy relationship. It was borderline abusive until it actually became abusive. It was on both sides. It wasn’t just that she was with someone dark—she found the darkness within herself. This has to do with the consequences of power," Whedon said.</p><p>Clearly, there are some dividing opinions on season six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and this is something that critics and fans are divided on, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Sarah Michelle Gellar Has Been In Since 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'</a></span></p><h2 id=season-6-is-divisive>Season 6 Is Divisive</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, season six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is rated as the worst season of the series. The critics gave it a 67%, which is much lower than the 90% that audiences gave it.</p><p>Noel Murray of the AV Club was not impressed with what the season did.</p><p>"It was some of the most daring and intricate storytelling that the Buffy writers had attempted to that point. And it was a self-indulgent wallow. I respect it. At times I was thrilled, amused and touched by it. But I didn't love it," Murray wrote.</p><p>On the audience side of things, one user gave the season a glowing review, even citing season 6 as their favorite.</p><p>"This is my favorite season overall! Great story telling and character development! As well as very dark themes coupled with plot elements that hit very close to home even if it is being told in this fictional supernatural universe. I have much love for this show but especially this season! A must watch for sure!!," they wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Katie Holmes Turned Down The Role Of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'</a></span></p><p>Season six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer appears to be its most polarizing, and to this day, there are those that love it, and those that loathe it.
