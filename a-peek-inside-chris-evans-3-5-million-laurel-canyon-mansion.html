The actor came to prominence in 2011 when he bagged the role of <a href=#>Steve Rogers for <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i></a>. Ever since he became a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he became one of the highest-grossing actors, with his movies earning billions at the box office. The actor earned $75 million alone from his work as Captain America and starred in several drama and mystery movies that brought his net worth to a solid $80 million. While Evans likes to keep his personal life under the radar, he is known to make hefty purchases in real estate. After receiving the role of Captain America, he purchased a&nbsp;<a href=#>home in Hollywood Hills worth $3.5 million</a>.</p><p>An old home restructured for the star, Chris Evans’ mansion offers scenic views and a cozy environment for a pleasant stay.</p><h2 id=a-home-after-fame>A Home After Fame</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evans struggled to make a breakthrough in Hollywood as a lead role. He previously starred in the <i>Fantastic Four</i> movies; however, he is now best recognized for being Steve Rogers in the MCU. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Evans was paid $300,000 to star in the 2011 movie <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>. He also earned a sizable salary in the 2012 movie <i>Avengers</i>. After making a good income from his movies, he decided to put a price on a home in California. Evans purchased the house for $3.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Calvin Klein's $25 Million Modern Hollywood Hills Home</a></span></p><h2 id=redesigned-by-the-best>Redesigned By The Best</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Located in the iconic neighborhood of Laurel Canyon, the expensive and exclusive area is popular as many celebrities reside in the region. The home was originally constructed in the 1940s and underwent major renovations in 2013. Stewart-Gulrajani Designs, a company best known in LA to renovate and flip homes, redesigned the house before Chris Evans purchased it in the same year. Paul Wylie of Lamerica, the parent company of Stewart-Gulrajani Designs, was the listing agent for the property, while Evans was represented by Rayni Romito’s Hilton & Hyland.</p><h2 id=comfortable-retreat>Comfortable Retreat</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, the home spread across nearly an acre of property with a 4,600 sq. ft. of the house in the center. Located on Torreyson Drive, <a href=#>the home features</a> three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms. Two bedrooms are Master Suites, while the third bedroom serves as a Staff Quarter. The Master Bedroom has a spacious walk-in closet and an ensuite bathroom with a steam shower, radiant heat, laundry room, free-standing tub, and interior made from Italian Calcutta marble and limestone. The mansion is surrounded by gated walls from all directions and offers breathtaking views of Los Angeles and the Santa Monica mountains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-seamless-indoor-outdoor-structure>A Seamless Indoor-Outdoor Structure</h2><p>One of the unique aspects of the home is that the indoors and outdoors merge into each other to offer a relaxing experience. The French windows and glass walls enhance the outdoors experience and offer lush views from every corner of the house. There are patios outside every room so guests can sit and enjoy the view of California.</p><h2 id=a-timeless-kitchen>A Timeless Kitchen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A home is never complete without a nice kitchen, and the mansion offers a gourmet kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances. The kitchen features stainless steel Wolf Kitchen appliances, along with a full wine fridge, a refrigerator, a built-in Miele coffee maker, custom cabinets, Italian Bianca marble countertops, and a dual Thermador dishwasher, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redfin</a>. The cookhouse effortlessly merges with the Family Room.</p><h2 id=cozy-indoors>Cozy Indoors</h2><p><a href=#>The homey Family Room and Living Rooms feature</a> glass walls that drench the room in sunlight at all times. The rooms have a beige and cream interior and feature a wood fireplace combined with abstract paintings. Next to these rooms is a Dining area offering a six-person dining table. They provide outdoor patio space that has six sun loungers for the guests to enjoy the Californian sun by the pool.</p><h2 id=bountiful-backyard>Bountiful Backyard</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A backyard is a significant aspect of any home, and Chris Evans has an equally stunning backyard as the interior of his home. Overlooking the city features a swimming pool with a spa, as reported by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>. The estate also has a firepit and deck along the lines of the swimming pool under tall trees and is the most secluded spot in the house for much-needed privacy.</p><h2 id=myriad-of-outdoor-amenities>Myriad Of Outdoor Amenities</h2><p>Situated in one of the finest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, Chris Evans has access to many outdoor amenities as an advantage of staying at a celebrity-only enclave. The actor has several famous neighbors around his residence, including Jack Nicholson, Jimi Hendrix, Ringo Starr, Joni Mitchell, Natalie Wood, and many more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever since the pandemic in March 2020, Chris Evans has abandoned his home to return to his hometown of Boston, Massachusetts, where he lives with his brother Scott and pet dog Dodger. He has been catching up on his reading and spending time with his family in his hometown. While the mansion remains unused, Chris Evans will be returning to Los Angeles when he begins promotion for two of his upcoming 2022 movies, <i>The Gray Man</i> and <i>Lightyear</i>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Celebrities Have The Most Expensive NFT Portfolios</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redfin</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYrCpvsisZJ6ukaPAbn%2BMbmSmoZyhtrC6jKWYrqqVoXqkrc2ypqdlnZa7tLXOp2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inside-tyson-furys-car-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inside-tyson-furys-car-collection.html>A Peek Inside The 'World Heavyweight Champion' Tyson Fury's Car Collection</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-was-ghosted-cancelled-after-one-season.html>Why Was 'Ghosted' Cancelled After One Season?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-was-ghosted-cancelled-after-one-season.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
