She recently portrayed Clea in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Theron announced in 2008 that she had obtained US citizenship. That same year, she was appointed as a United Nations Messenger of Peace. She is also well-known for her work in the AIDS fight.</p><p>Theron's campaign for an AIDS-free South Africa began with youth empowerment. During a meeting with South African President <strong>Jacob Zuma</strong>, the Hollywood actress pledged her support for the fight against Aids.</p><p>While she helped a lot of people in this campaign, Charlize Theron has also faced many problems during her weight gain journey and some also say the actress also gained weight to fit in the role in a movie, Tully. So, let's get in-depth to the topic!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> efforts of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Zach Wilson</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Victoria Beckham</a>.</strong></p><h2>Charlize Theronâ€™s Weight Gain: How Much Weight Did Charlize Theron Gain for Tully? Look at Her Pictures Now!</h2><p>Talking about weight gain, there are various rumors and controversies that the South African-born American actress, <strong>Charlize Theron</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@charlizeafrica</a>) gained weight for various reasons and one of which is her role in the movie Tully. Well, Charlize Theron did gain weight for her role in the film Tully. She successfully gained around <strong>50 pounds</strong>, which later had a negative impact on her health.</p><p>Charlize Theron underwent some pretty drastic physical transformations for film roles over the course of her career, but gaining 50 pounds for her new film, Tully&nbsp;was still extremely difficult. So, while having a free pass to eat whatever you want may sound like a lot of fun, it had some extremely difficult side effects for Theron.</p><p>Even though it was the actor's decision to weight gain for the role, it is clear that she later regretted it. She explained that by gaining 50 pounds all of a sudden, she was confronted with depression. This also demonstrates the actor's incredible dedication to her work. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Theron <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a>,</p><p>"I gained close to 50 pounds for this film. I just I wanted to feel what this woman felt, and I think that was a way for me to get closer to her and get into that mindset."</p><p>The 46-year-old American actress described that her main motivation for weight gain for the film Tully was to relate to the character she was playing. She wanted to experience and feel how her character felt, but she had no idea depression would be a side effect. The actress stated that she only had three months to gain weight for her role in the film.</p><p>Charlize Theron (<a href=# rel=noopener>@charlizetheron902</a>) also stated that the early stages of weight gain were enjoyable and that she felt like a child eating chips and chocolates without thinking. Day after day, because she was forcing herself to overfeed, it began to feel like a job, and her mental health was already deteriorating.</p><p>Charlize Theron had to go to extreme measures, such as waking up in the middle of the night for a snack. According to the actress, her favorite food was sweet potato, which helped her gain weight quickly. Prior to gaining weight for her film, Theoren was a very healthy and fit person who ate everything in moderation and followed a proper diet. She ate far too much sugar and junk food to gain weight so quickly which helped in her weight gain journey.</p><p>Experts believe that sugar and processed foods are directly linked to depression, which could be why she began to feel depressed. Many of her fans were concerned when they saw the actress's significant weight gain.</p><p>Her fans were also impressed by the actress's commitment and discipline in order to gain weight. The actress had more difficulty losing weight than gaining weight. It took her about a year and a half to lose all of the weight she had gained for the film.</p><p>However, the actress' willingness to gain 50 pounds for a movie role demonstrates her dedication to acting. Moreover, as of 2022, Charlize Theron weighs around <strong>120 pounds</strong> and is happy with her body now.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGibopxdmLWivsuisZ5lpJ2ys7vNZp6aoZ5ixKa1xqGrZp6fp3q1wculsGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-charlize-theron-gain-weight-for-tully.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-charlize-theron-gain-weight-for-tully.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-charlize-theron-gain-weight-for-tully.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-charlize-theron-gain-weight-for-tully.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-charlize-theron-gain-weight-for-tully.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-charlize-theron-gain-weight-for-tully.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-puddle-pants-to-buy-this-season.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-puddle-pants-to-buy-this-season.html>Heres How You Can Wear Puddle Pants Like Kylie Jenner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ernestine-sclafani-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wife-of-skip-bayless.html>Ernestine Sclafani: All you need to know about the wife of Skip Bayless</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ernestine-sclafani-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wife-of-skip-bayless.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
