The Irish diaspora, Irish nationalism, Irish history, and London life all had an impact on MacGowan’s songwriting.</p><p style=text-align:justify>MacGowan, an Irishman born in Kent, England, first played in the punk group the Nipple Erectors before starting the Pogues in 1982. When beginning the Pogues, he took inspiration from his Irish background and, with the help of his extended family, transformed his early punk style into a more traditional sound.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He co-wrote the Christmas smash single “Fairytale of New York” between 1985 and 1987, and he sang it with Kirsty MacColl. He also sang “Dirty Old Town,” “Sally MacLennane,” and “The Irish Rover” (with the Dubliners) with the Pogues, among other well-known tunes.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Pogues reached their pinnacle of economic success in 1988 with the publication of their highly regarded album, If I Should Fall from Grace with God. The Pogues dismissed MacGowan for acting unprofessionally during a tour in 1991.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After that, he started a new group called Shane MacGowan and The Popes, and the two of them made two studio albums. MacGowan returned to the Pogues in 2001 for reunion performances, and he stayed with the group until 2014.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Along with working with musicians like Joe Strummer, Nick Cave, Steve Earle, Sinéad O’Connor, and Ronnie Drew, he also produced solo music. MacGowan was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award and an Ivor Novello Inspiration Award in 2018.
