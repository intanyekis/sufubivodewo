They end up making love again and hate that they must leave today. Trina says she’s going to remember every moment of the trip. Spencer enjoyed watching her in her element in the art museums. They profess their love to one another.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/trina-spencer-ny-surprise-gh-abc.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Trina gushes about how she feels this trip has helped her see art in a new way, including through the artist’s eyes. Spencer thinks she sees so much more when she looks at a painting, including the underlying humanity in it. He calls her a vibrant person, an empathetic person, who has completed parts of him he never expected to feel so fulfilled.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spencer-trina-ny-surprise-gh-abc.jpg alt="Spencer Trina in NY GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Spencer says they still have time before they leave and they could go out for one last meal. She says she’d rather get room service. Trina wishes they could stay in New York, in bed, forever. He agrees, but there are people in Port Charles who will miss her. She knows she has to get back to her parents, and he has Ace. Room service arrives and Spencer grabs it for them.</p><p>After breakfast they pack up and print their boarding passes out.&nbsp; Trina says goodbye to the room, and thanks it for the memories.</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Donna Mills in upcoming Lifetime Chrismas movie</a></p><p>Anna arrives at Valentin’s new house and says, “So this is where you’ve been hiding?” He explains he’s not hiding, he’s making a new home for them. Charlotte appears wondering why the front door is open and stops dead in her tracks when she sees Anna. Anna says hello to Charlotte, who asks how she likes their new home. Anna says it’s lovely. Charlotte claims she’s off to the skate park to meet Jake and quickly exits.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/charlotte-big-trouble-gh-abc.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Anna looks around the place, and Valentin says he owes her an apology. Valentin says he’s been keeping secrets. She laughs and calls it a pattern in their relationship. Valentin explains he had Martin try and secure this home for them after the fire, and it wasn’t easy. She admits she followed him here that day, but didn’t know it was Martin he was meeting. Charlotte eavesdrops as Anna asks why Valentin felt the need to keep this a secret. Valentin says he didn’t want to disappoint her if the deal fell through, and he bought the house for her and Charlotte to start a life together. Charlotte shakes her head.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/val-confronted-secret-gh-abc.jpg alt="Valentin lies GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Anna tells Valentin it is a beautiful house, perfect even. Valentin just wanted to ride in like a white knight and save her, but he should have asked what she wanted. However, all he’s ever wanted is a life with her. Still listening in, Charlotte thinks back to the note Victor sent her warning her about Anna. He warned her that Valentin was going down a dark path, he’s become weak, and forgotten the importance of family since falling in love with Anna. Victor accused Anna of controlling her father, and she is not who she seems and she should not trust Anna. He tells her to never forget that the Cassadine women are the most formidable members of their family, and he knows she won’t let Anna destroy their family. He advises her to be wary, be armed, stay strong and use any weapon to defeat Anna. Victor further warned Charlotte that Anna will lead Valentin to his death, and Charlotte is the only one who can protect her father from Anna. He says to guide her, he’s giving her these tarot cards to protect and save her father. He calls them valuable tools, and weapons…</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/charlotte-gets-cards-gh-abc.jpg alt="Charlotte gets cards GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Anna says Valentin might not have handled this perfectly, but the sentiment is beautiful. Valentin says now that they have the house, unfortunately, things have changed. He explains these past few months he lost focus on what is going on with his daughter. He realizes he needs to give her his undivided attention right now. Anna understands. Valentin says he bought the house for her, but now is not the time for her to move in. Anna notes his love for his daughter is beautiful. He promises they’ll move in when the time is right. Charlotte spies on them as they kiss, and thinks about Victor’s words warning her about Anna.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/anna-val-secret-gh-abc.jpg alt="Anna Val hiding GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Laura Wright addresses status rumors</a></p><p>At the hospital, in an exam room, Finn checks over Chase, who got pepper sprayed during an incident.
