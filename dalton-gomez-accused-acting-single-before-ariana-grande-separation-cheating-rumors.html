According to Us Weekly, the pair split up in January 2023 but a source told TMZ of their separation in July 2023. Of course, many fans were surprised by Grande's swift engagement to the LA real estate agent after her highly publicized engagement with Pete Davidson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Dalton Gomez has been <a href=#>the focus of many of Grande's steamiest lyrics</a>. On top of this, the secrecy of their romance was seemingly productive. At least when contrasted with the attention Grande's previous relationship received. Given the suddenness of it all, fans have been wondering what really happened. And a blind source told Deux Moi a story that got many thinking that Gomez could've cheated on her. Here's what we know for sure and what's a completely unproven rumor...</p><h2 id=did-dalton-gomez-cheat-on-ariana-grande>Did Dalton Gomez Cheat On Ariana Grande?</h2><p>It's natural for fans to wonder if cheating had anything to do with a celebrity breakup. Especially when the stars are as young and hot as Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez. Their July 2023 separation announcement also came out of nowhere, suggesting that drama happened behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a blind source on Deux Moi, the source of this drama may have been Dalton Gomez seeing other women on the side. At least, this was the thinking before it was revealed that Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly separated since January 2023</a>, months before the source had an interesting encounter with the real estate agent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/how-ariana-grande-s-husband-dalton-gomez-keeps-a-low-profile-instead-of-embracing-fame.jpg><p>Deux Moi's blind sources are almost never investigated. Meaning that they can spread a lot of phony information. However, they also get some leads that have been proven somewhat accurate. This includes <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White's separation from his wife Addison Timlin</a>. This is because sources tend to come clean with some facts if they know that their identities won't be revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, it's important to remember that the source that told Deux Moi that Dalton Gomez was "acting single" has not been vetted and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the source's experience with Dalton Gomez at an unnamed Hollywood party caused a stir amongst Deux Moi's 1.9 million followers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Did Ariana Grande's Friends Think Of Dalton Gomez Before Their Split After 2 Years Of Marriage?</a></span></p><p>"So back in March [2023], I attended an event where there were a bunch of celebrities. Dalton was there, but he was being low-key (was wearing a hat, shades).

He had his own cabana with his friends, and he was not acting married."</p><p>This reportedly caused the source's "drunk" friend to do something about it on behalf of Ariana Grande.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariana Grande's "7 Rings" Was A Hit But Did Nothing For Her Net Worth, Here's Why The Song Actually Lost Money</a></span></p><p>"So my drunk friend wanted to call him out on it. She approached him, and said "Do you know who Ariana Grande is?" He literally said, "Never heard of her before." So my friend said, "well you should, that's your WIFE!!!"

However, it's highly unlikely that this was proof Dalton Gomez cheated on Ariana Grande. They were separated after all. In actuality, it appears as though Gomez was actually trying to keep a low profile as to not reveal the secret that he and Grande were headed for divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-did-ariana-grande-s-friends-think-of-dalton-gomez-before-their-split-after-2-years-of-marriage_.jpg><p>According to The Daily Mail, Dalton Gomez has been "back on the dating scene" for "months".

Their relationship has been rocky at different points, and they’ve had trouble making time for each other with scheduling issues," the source said to ET.</p><p>The others claim that Grande's fame may have been a factor as it impacted Gomez's life. The distance between his home base in LA and hers all over the world may have also been a contributing factor.
