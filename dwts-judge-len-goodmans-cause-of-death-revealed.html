Who am I? I’m just a dance teacher from Dartford. Suddenly, I’m thrust into Hollywood. I got the reputation for being the tough judge, because what I see is what I say.”</p><p>In addition to both his judging duties, Goodman appeared as a presenter for multiple shows including “Partners in Rhyme,” “Holiday of My Lifetime With Len Goodman” and “Dancing Cheek to Cheek: An Intimate History of Dance.”</p><p>The former dancer was also no stranger to health issues. In 2009, he was treated for prostate cancer after secretly battling it during some seasons of both “Strictly” and “DWTS.” He also revealed in 2020 through the UK’s Melanoma Fund that he received surgery for a facial melanoma on his forehead.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In addition to both his judging duties, Goodman appeared as a presenter for multiple shows including “Partners in Rhyme,” “Holiday of My Lifetime With Len Goodman” and “Dancing Cheek to Cheek: An Intimate History of Dance.” <span class=credit>ABC</span></figure><p>Goodman reportedly urged others to “get checked up every year,” according to his book “<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Better Late Than Never</a>.”</p><p>“Medicine is [so advanced] now that if you do get something, then hopefully they can catch it early and you have a good chance,” he wrote.</p><p>“DWTS” honored the late judge at the beginning of the show’s 32nd season, which <a href=#>premiered last month</a>.</p><p>“We’re obviously missing a big part of our ‘Dancing With the Stars’ family tonight,” said co-host Alfonso Ribeiro.</p><p>His co-host, Julianne Hough, called the late judge “irreplaceable” and noted that the show intended to “keep his spirit” alive by renaming the coveted mirrorball trophy the “Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy.”</p><p>Goodman is survived by his wife Sue Barrett and son from a previous relationship, James Goodman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaWpfmcS1v4yjrJ2flWK5prqMoKaonJ2Wu7R5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6FloprDpq3Lnpto</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdwts-judge-len-goodmans-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdwts-judge-len-goodmans-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdwts-judge-len-goodmans-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdwts-judge-len-goodmans-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdwts-judge-len-goodmans-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdwts-judge-len-goodmans-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-idris-elba-tilda-swinton-friends-in-real-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-idris-elba-tilda-swinton-friends-in-real-life.html>Are 'Three Thousand Years Of Longing' Stars Idris Elba And Tilda Swinton Friends In Real Life?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lorna-omondi-ogolla.html>Who is Lorna Omondi Ogolla?
