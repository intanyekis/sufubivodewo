His wife, Kristen Robinson, announced the heartbreaking news of his untimely passing in a social media post.</p><h2>Who was Charlie Robinson?</h2><p>He was a notable artist best known for his song‘ My Hometown’ which made the country charts. He was also a judge on a reality TV show ‘Nashville Star’ on USA Networks for one year. His contribution to the country music revolutionized Texas music.</p><h2>Early life and music</h2><p>Robinson was born on September 1, 1964, in Houston, Texas. But he was raised in Bandera, Texas. He loved his hometown, where he played football. His football career came to an end as a result of an injury. When one door closes, another opens. He moved to Austin and began his country music career with his 1996 album ‘Bandera’, named after his hometown.</p><p>Two years later, in 1998, he released another album ‘Life of the Party’ under the record label Sony’s Subsidiary ‘Luck Dog Records.’ It had many songs that resonated with the audience. His most loved song, ‘My Hometown’ and ‘Loving Country’ was from this album.</p><p>He signed with Columbia Records and released ‘Step Right Up’ in 2001, which contained his only song that made it to the Top 40 Country singles, ‘I Want You So Bad’. He released his final album in 2013 ‘High Life’. He retired from singing after a surgical procedure was done on his throat, limiting him from ever singing again.</p><p>He announced his retirement with a note that said,</p><p>“With a very heavy heart, I am officially retiring from the stage and studio,” he continues. “It’s been an amazing ride, and I cannot tell you all what the last 25 years has meant to me. I was looking forward to another 25, but as they say ‘shit happens.”</p><p>‘Life of The Party’ is considered a standard album for the country music artist. He combined his love for his hometown and country music with grittiness, southern Hard Rock, and ingenuity, transformed the genre, and paved the path for modern country music.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>In 1998, Cahrlie Robinson married Emily Erwin, now known as Strayer, who founded the band ‘Chicks.’ According to a newspaper, their love inspired the ‘Chicks’ song ‘Cowboy Take Me Away’. Together they had three children. They parted ways in 2008 and got divorced due to unknown reasons.</p><p>He remarried and tied the knot with Kristen Robinson. He remained with her until his death stole him from her. He lived with her in San Antonio, where he died at a hospital, surrounded by loved ones.</p><h2>Funeral and Obituary</h2><p>His family will provide the details of his memorial service at a later date. His wife shared the news of his passing on social media in her <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> </span>that said;</p><p>“It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that my husband,<span style=color:red>&nbsp;<a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Charlie Robison</a></span>&nbsp;has passed away today, surrounded by his family and friends. My heart is broken. Please pray for me, our children and our family.”</p><h2>Tributes</h2><p>His fans are heartbroken by the news of their favourite icon. Many have come forward with their overwhelming support for his family.</p><p>Glenn Cook Photography wrote,</p><p>“I’m so sorry. Devastating.
