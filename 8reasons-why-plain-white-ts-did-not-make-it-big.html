The acoustic song, with its saccharine lyrics depicting a long-distance romance, eventually reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 2007. The single became the golden ticket that opened the door to fame for the band, whose start began in 1997, playing basement gigs in Illinois.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seemed like The Plain White T's had finally made it. "Hey There Delilah" went platinum and earned two Grammy nominations. But the rocket to the top would soon run out of fuel for the pop-punk band. After their meteoric rise in 2007, here are some potential reasons Plain White T's never reached their anticipated stardom.</p><h2 id=rising-too-high-too-fast><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rising Too High, Too Fast</span></h2><p>When the sleeper hit "Hey There Delilah" finally caught flame, it was a year after it was initially released off the band's third studio album, All That We Needed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The band's lead singer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Higgenson, told Chron about his struggles with the sudden stardom</a>. “It seemed like everything I always wanted came at the exact same time,” he said. “I didn’t know how to really enjoy any of it because it was so much happening so fast."</p><h2 id=the-story-behind-quot-hey-there-delilah-quot-was-far-from-romantic><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Story Behind "Hey There Delilah" Was Far From Romantic</span></h2><p>While fans were singing along to Higgenson's ode to the girl who shined brighter than Times Square, many were disappointed to find out that the real Delilah did not return his heartfelt sentiments.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Higgenson wrote the song after meeting Delilah DiCrescenzo in 2002</a>. She was dating someone else at the time and turned the songwriter down. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DiCrescenzo later told ESPN in 2013</a>, ""I was nervous that I'd let Tom's fans down. They'd be disappointed to hear I have a boyfriend. Every girl would want a song written about her, and they'd think I was ungrateful and rude to deny Tom.""</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-delilah-quot-pigeonholed-the-band><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>"Delilah" Pigeonholed The Band</span></h2><p>The acoustic phenomenon that was "Hey There Delilah" retreated from the band's pop-punk style, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made it hard to return to their roots</a>. Unlike other punk-pop stars, such as Avril Lavigne, whose hit <a href=#>"Sk8er Boi" gave her the spotlight to do other types of music and earn millions</a>, Plain White Ts wound up pigeonholed.</p><p>Higgenson told Billboard, "What we really think is that people don’t want to just hear us with an acoustic guitar. They just want to hear us do something that connects with them, whether it’s to a piano or guitar or full band — whatever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Follow-up singles like "1,2,3,4" and "Rhythm of Love" echoed the same gentleness of "Delilah", displacing them even farther from their staple style.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>2000s One Hit Wonders: What Are They Up To Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=album-delays-at-hollywood-records><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Album Delays At Hollywood Records</span></h2><p>The band had been signed to Hollywood Records when gearing up to release their seventh studio album, "American Nights." But they faced delays on behalf of the label.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Higgenson spoke to The Chicago Tribune about the final days at Hollywood Records</a> saying, "It felt like we were in career limbo... It was time to move on. Last summer we went on tour and there was no momentum: 'Why are we out here?' There was no game plan. We knew we had to get out of there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Paramore Still Making Music?

The reality was that the band was not as financially successful as it would seem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The band's guitarist, Dave Tirio, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Orange County Register</a>, "The truth is you have to have a lot of success before you make a lot of money. We haven’t yet. Most of us still live at home when we go home. I sleep in the same bed I did my whole life. My car is still dead in the driveway. We’re still living very, very meager."</p><h2 id=nickelodeon-and-abc-family-appearances><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Nickelodeon And ABC Family Appearances</span></h2><p>While signed to Hollywood Records, <a href=#>the band made an appearance on the teen sitcom </a><a href=#>iCarly</a> and had a four-episode arc on the ABC Family series Greek.</p><p>Higgenson spoke to The Dallas Observer in 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shrugging off the idea of appearing on a teen show</a> affecting the band's image. "I don't think there are any rules anymore." he said, "A band like Phoenix can get big from being in a car commercial, and having a song on a video game is what breaks more bands these days."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The appearance of both shows could have potentially shifted the band's targeted demographic, attaching them to a teen audience, while causing older fans to lose interest.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Miranda Cosgrove After 'iCarly'?</a></span></p><h2 id=plain-white-t-39-s-may-actually-be-one-hit-wonders><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Plain White T's May Actually Be One-Hit-Wonders</span></h2><p>While the band has gone on to have notable singles after "Hey There Delilah", none of them have had the impact of the acoustic hit. The song's prominence seems to have eclipsed their later releases. It was the song that put the band on the map and, as unexpected as it was, was a memorable success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But I never thought it would be a hit, just because it’s a little acoustic thing." Higgenson told The Orange County Register, You never expect that song to be the one you go to as a release. Expect it to be a big, hooky rock song."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvq52RqLyvv4ywn7JloKGuqrqMsJ%2BirJViwbR5w6KbZqafqXqurcqeZKKsXZe2qHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8reasons-why-plain-white-ts-did-not-make-it-big.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8reasons-why-plain-white-ts-did-not-make-it-big.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8reasons-why-plain-white-ts-did-not-make-it-big.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8reasons-why-plain-white-ts-did-not-make-it-big.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8reasons-why-plain-white-ts-did-not-make-it-big.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8reasons-why-plain-white-ts-did-not-make-it-big.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-george-clooney-use-brad-pitt-to-prank-meryl-streep.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-george-clooney-use-brad-pitt-to-prank-meryl-streep.html>Did George Clooney Use Brad Pitt To Prank Meryl Streep?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shakira-dating-rumors-with-f1-champ-lewis-hamilton-after-allegedly-gifted-a-versace-blouse.html>Shakira Sparks Dating Rumors With F1 Champ Lewis Hamilton After He Allegedly Gifted Her A Versace Bl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shakira-dating-rumors-with-f1-champ-lewis-hamilton-after-allegedly-gifted-a-versace-blouse.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
