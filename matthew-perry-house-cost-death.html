However, there is still no doubt that Friends is a big part of Perry's legacy since the show made millions of people laugh.</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>Friends also made Perry and his co-stars rich</a>. For that reason, there was a lot of interest in Perry's estate, including about <a href=#>the heartbreaking rule in his will</a> and <a href=#>if he left anything to his ex-girlfriend</a>. However, many of Perry's fans don't know about the amazing mansion Perry bought before he died but never got to live in.</p><p>This article will reveal what is known about <strong>the incredible mansion Matthew Perry bought before he passed</strong>. Then, the article will look at <strong>where Perry was living when he took his final breath</strong> far too early in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-bought-a-5-million-mansion-months-before-his-tragic-passing>Matthew Perry Bought A $5 Million Mansion Months Before His Tragic Passing</h2><p>Before Matthew Perry tragically passed away, he released a book about his life titled "Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir". In that book, Perry wrote a sad truth about how he thought people would react when he lost his life. “It is very odd to live in a world where if you died, it would shock people but surprise no one.”</p><p>Based on that quote, some people may have thought Perry didn't expect to live long. However, the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Perry bought a new mansion for roughly $5 million only months before he died</strong></a> proves he was still making plans for his future.</p><p>In May 2024, The Daily Mail published an article that revealed many details about that mansion. Based on The Daily Mail's reporting, Perry bought a truly incredible home in the final months of his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/matthew-perry-premiere-of-cinderella-man.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First off, The Daily Mail revealed that <strong>the mansion was located in The Hollywood Hills</strong> on a 9,622-square-foot lot. The home, which reportedly was 2,566 square feet in size, also featured three bedrooms and four bathrooms.</p><p>Years before Matthew Perry died, he owned a mansion in Malibu. Instead of selling the property when he moved out, he turned the mansion into a sober living house for others recovering from addiction. Perry eventually closed the sober living house down, however, and explained that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it became, "too expensive to run"</a> .</p><p>More specifically, The Daily Mail reported that Perry paid $4,995,000 when he closed the deal for the mansion on May 31st, 2023. Another interesting thing that The Daily Mail reported was that the mansion came fully furnished when Perry bought it.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/one-of-matthew-perry-s-famous-co-stars-labeled-him-a-_nightmare_-to-work-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>One Of Matthew Perry's Famous Co-Stars Labeled Him A "Nightmare" To Work With</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Elizabeth Hurley became extremely frustrated with Matthew Perry when they co-starred in a mostly forgotten rom-com together</span><p>Up until this point, everything that has been revealed about the mansion makes it sound fantastic. However, <strong>the home's design details are what makes it stand out</strong> and sound like it would have been a great place for Perry to live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Daily Mail's reporting, the mansion was designed to have a "classic look". The outlet also went on to detail how the home has exterior walls of glass that surround a patio with a pool which is situated at the center of the property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/matthew-perry-vanity-fair.jpg><p>As The Daily Mail's reporting confirms, the glass walls allow the house to enjoy natural lighting all day long. For anyone who enjoys nature, the appeal of that is obvious.</p><p>That said, it is easy to imagine how a person like Perry living in a house with glass walls to the outside could be very problematic. After all, Perry was a huge star, so it is easy to imagine fans and the paparazzi trying to get a look at him in his home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lisa-kudrow-wasn-t-the-only-friends-actor-to-play-two-different-roles-during-the-show-s-run.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow Wasn't The Only Friends Actor To Play Two Different Roles During The Show's Run</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Every Friends fan knows that Lisa Kudrow played Phoebe and Ursula on the show but very few know about the other actors with two roles.</span><p>However, according to The Daily Mail, it seems like Perry had a good reason to not worry about people trying to see into his home. The reason for that is that the outlet reports that <strong>the mansion actually provided a great deal of privacy</strong>.</p><p>After Matthew Perry passed away, his estate eventually put the Hollywood Hills mansion he bought up for sale. At that time, it was reported that <a href=#>the mansion was listed for $5,195,000</a> .</p><p>Part of the outlet's report detailed how the mansion Perry bought was surrounded by gates that would have provided privacy for the Friends star. Once the gate was opened, it led to a two-car garage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/matthew-perry-paparazzi-photo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly for the former Friends star and everyone who cared about him, <strong>Perry never got the chance to move into that mansion</strong>. The reason for that is that Perry passed away on October 28, 2023, and he didn't move into the mansion by that point.</p><p>How long did Matthew Perry live, according to Britannica?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Matthew Perry born?:</p></td><td><p>August 19, 1969</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When did Matthew Perry die?:</p></td><td><p>October 28, 2023</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How long did Matthew Perry live?:</p></td><td><p>54 years, 2 months, and 9 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>After Perry passed away, it was revealed that the beloved actor lost his life due to, “acute effects of ketamine”.</p><h2 id=where-was-matthew-perry-living-when-he-died>Where Was Matthew Perry Living When He Died?</h2><p>According to an article from Yahoo! Entertainment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Matthew Perry was living in the Pacific Palisades when his life ended</strong></a>. The outlet reported that Perry hadn't been living there for too long, however, as he reportedly bought the final place he called home in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-matt-leblanc-ever-feud-with-david-schwimmer-and-matthew-perry-during-their-time-on-friends_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Matt LeBlanc Ever Feud With David Schwimmer And Matthew Perry During Their Time On Friends?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer portrayed best friends but they may not have gotten along all the time behind the scenes.</span><p>For anyone who cared about Perry, the first thing to know about the final place he lived is that he seemed to love it. After all, People spoke to an insider who said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Perry called his Pacific Palisades home, "heaven"</strong></a>.</p><p>Yahoo! Entertainment also reported that before Perry moved into the home, it had been newly renovated. It makes sense that the home got a facelift as it reportedly was built in 1965. However, that meant that Perry had to wait a while to move in after he bought the home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/matthew-perry-2015.jpg><p>In the rest of Yahoo!
