At the time, <a href=#>Mavis admitted she never thought she would get married</a>. By the time she and Jay met, they were in their mid-thirties (Mavis is four years older than Jay), so she had resigned herself to never marrying.</p><p>The two had something of a meet-cute after one of Jay's shows, during which Mavis sat in the front row. But Jay, who didn't drink, wasn't up for buying Mavis a drink, either, and bought her a shirt during their first 'date.'</p><p>Mavis later reflected that she knew she had found her person in Jay, despite his quirks.</p><p>"With Jay, I began to realize that this was the first time I was ever with someone where I had a perfect, calm sense of having arrived at my destination."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two eventually got married, not after a proposal, but when Jay realized he could only protect Mavis if they were married, and she had access to his insurance.

It was revealed through a court filing that Leno's wife had dementia, something he had kept otherwise quiet.</p><p>The paperwork claimed that Mavis had been "progressively losing capacity and orientation to space and time for several years." The paperwork included a doctor's note that specified "impairments to concentration and memory," leaving Mavis struggling to recognize people. Tragically, the dementia also meant Mavis didn't recognize her husband, either.</p><p>Leno's lawyer wrote in court documents that Mavis "sometimes does not know her husband" and "has a lot of disorientation." Still, Mavis remained at home at the time of Jay's court filing, with the documents suggesting she was happy in their shared home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jay-leno-lives-below-his-means-here-s-how-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jay Leno Lives Below His Means, Here's How</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>His immense net worth of more than $450 million didn’t come to be without a frugal lifestyle.</span><p>All the information on Mavis' diagnosis stems from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay's January 2024 court filing</a>, where he requested financial conservatorship of his wife. In April, his petition was granted, meaning Jay received the ability to determine how to handle Mavis' estate. The court documents also suggest that Jay has long handled the couple's finances, indicating that Mavis would approve of her husband's decisions if she were able to understand and communicate.</p><h2 id=mavis-and-jay-leno-enjoyed-a-long-happy-marriage>Mavis And Jay Leno Enjoyed A Long Happy Marriage</h2><h3 id=the-worst-part-of-mavis-and-jay-39-s-marriage-may-be-that-she-can-no-longer-remember-it>The worst part of Mavis and Jay's marriage may be that she can no longer remember it</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jay-leno-s-long-term-partner-vowed-never-to-have-kids-or-get-married-here-s-why-front-back-deposit.jpg><p>With so many wonderful years of marriage (according to both Jay and Mavis) behind them, the future is uncertain for Jay and Mavis. As anyone who has experienced dementia in a loved one can attest to, it's something of a rollercoaster ride, and the ultimate destination is not a pleasant one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We've been through the death of my parents and his and the loss of Jay's brother. We started off with not very much money, and now we have a lot. But we've stayed the same. The great thing about Jay is whatever he says, that's it. It's genuine." — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mavis Leno in 2009</a></p><p>Given that Mavis no longer recognized her husband all of the time in early 2024, it is likely to get much worse for both as the disease progresses. Jay, keeping the details of his wife's condition private save for the court process, may decide to enlist the help of caregivers — or may have already done so — to keep Mavis comfortable at home.</p><p>Sadly for them both, dementia only ends in one way. The only question is how quickly it will progress, and what measures can be taken to keep Mavis comfortable. Of course, given <a href=#>how frugally Jay lives (his one splurge is a fancy car)</a>, he could pour a fortune into ensuring his beloved wife is well cared for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmrFdobKvu4ywoJ%2BdXaKut7XSZqOepp9iv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedKam2asoqrBqXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjay-leno-wife-mavis-leno-relationship-sad-truth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjay-leno-wife-mavis-leno-relationship-sad-truth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjay-leno-wife-mavis-leno-relationship-sad-truth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjay-leno-wife-mavis-leno-relationship-sad-truth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjay-leno-wife-mavis-leno-relationship-sad-truth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjay-leno-wife-mavis-leno-relationship-sad-truth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jane-fonda-on-megyn-kelly-scandal-after-plastic-surgery-debacle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jane-fonda-on-megyn-kelly-scandal-after-plastic-surgery-debacle.html>Jane Fonda on Megyn Kelly Scandal After Plastic Surgery Debacle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./forest-mecchi-died.html>Bad News!
