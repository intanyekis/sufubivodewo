Though he was eliminated in week 6, he later appeared on Bachelor in Paradise season 3 wherein he was also eliminated in the 6th week. He returned again for seasons 4 to 6. In 2021, he replaced Chris Harrison as host. "It was a lot, I have to be honest with you," Adams said of his then-new role. "It was really fun, but I'm really good at just giving advice to people at the bar and just telling people how I really feel...Going from, like, silly Wells to serious Wells was harder than I thought it was going to be." It was a promotion from being the show's resident bartender.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Don’t get me wrong, like, hanging out with David Spade on a beach filming a television show is pretty freaking awesome," Adams told Us Weekly about being the "master of ceremonies." He also noted that "the stars of that show are not the people who are hosting it or the people who are serving drinks." He explained: "The stars are the people who are in those relationships and the best jobs are done by the people who are able to take a backseat and let the story unfold. It’s a roundabout way of saying like, 'I would love to have anyone who wants to come down there, Ben can come down and hang out with me as much as he wants, but the truth of the matter is that I want everyone to focus on what's important, which is the love stories.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then expressed his love for his job despite its challenges. "And so sometimes that could come across as a little convoluted if there's too many cooks in the kitchen," he continued. "But I'm just excited to get back down there. It was so much fun to do this last season. It was a return to normalcy because we had taken a year off and not to pump own up tires up much, but that show success rate is really good. I wanna see more beautiful love stories unfold on a crab-infested beach."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This 'Modern Family' Star Underwent Eight Plastic Surgeries</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-sarah-hyland-amp-wells-adams-meet>How Did Sarah Hyland & Wells Adams Meet?</h2><p>During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2018, Hyland revealed that she met Adams when he "slid into my DMs." She recalled: "Have you seen those memes of 'Slide Into the DMs'? That. He slid into my DMs. I thought he was funny, and he was a fan of [my] show. I saw him as the bartender and I was like, 'That's really cute!'" She added that the Bachelor Nation star's message was a good balance of "sexy" and wasn't "aggressive" at all. "I was single, obviously, and was like, 'This is really awesome. You're being very forward," she continued. "But very confident and sexy, and I liked that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their relationship became official in public back in October 2017. A year later, Hyland credited Adams for helping her cope with her battle with kidney dysplasia. "He's seen me at my worst," she told Self magazine. "I think that’s why I feel the most beautiful in his eyes, because he still finds me beautiful after seeing all that. It was a really intimate start to a relationship to have to go through those hurdles at the very, very, very beginning when you're just even getting to know a person."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same month, Adams described her as the "real-life version" of Wonder Woman. "Imagine having a vital organ replaced. Imagine having 16 surgeries, going to hundreds of doctors visits and taking thousands of pills. Imagine losing crazy weight because of dialysis, medication side effects and stress. Then imagine, having to do it all over again. This time keeping it quiet while you recovered, all while trolls on the internet judged you for your appearance," he told Us Weekly back then. "Oh, and throw in filming the funniest show on TV and executive producing and starring in a movie … and never breaking down. Never losing it. I know Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman on film, but Sarah is the real-life version."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These 'Modern Family' Twins Hated Their Time On The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-sarah-hyland-amp-wells-adams-get-married>Did Sarah Hyland & Wells Adams Get Married?</h2><p>The couple got engaged in July 2019.
