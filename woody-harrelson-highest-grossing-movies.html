is a hypnotist and a mentalist who was once incredibly famous and wealthy in his younger days.</p><p>However, after his brother absconded and takes all of his money, he is quickly looking for a way back to his wealth, which is how he ends up being involved in the movie's heists, with the four magicians looking to earn as much as possible.</p><p>The film has a fantastic and unique story, which is unlike something that has ever been created before and&nbsp;with a star-studded cast putting in some fantastic performances, it isn't a surprise the movie did so well.</p><strong

stunning series of movies that took the series to a totally new level.</p><p>Woody Harrelson was part of the War For The Planet Of The Apes movie, which was incredibly well-received both critically

way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film is a disaster movie with Earth being destroyed by a variety of natural disasters and the film did very well, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing movie of 2009, showing just how popular it became.</p><p>While it isn't going to challenge you to critically think or focus, it is plenty of fun if you're able to not take things too seriously, hence why it did so well after some incredible promotion.</p><h2 id=venom-lifetime-gross-213-515-506>Venom (Lifetime Gross: $213,515,506)</h2><p>Venom took an interesting twist on the popular comic book movie idea, focusing the film on a villain rather than a hero such as Spider-Man, with Tom Hardy playing the role of Venom incredibly well.</p><p>For those who didn't watch the post-credits scene, you will not have seen Woody Harrelson's part in the film, but he does appear in what is a tease for the character Carnage, which he is rumored to be playing in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The Avengers Franchise: Every Cast

incredible sums of money at the box office, and Solo: A Star Wars Story was no different in that regards.</p><p>While the film wasn't technically part of the Star Wars main series, this spin-off focused on one of Star Wars' most popular characters, Han Solo, which is another reason why the movie performed so well at the box office.</p><p>In the film, Woody Harrelson played the role of&nbsp;Tobias Beckett who was effectively the mentor of Han Solo, with the character actually being based off Treasure Island's Long John Silver.</p><h2
