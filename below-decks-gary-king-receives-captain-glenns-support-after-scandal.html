It’s not about how you fall but how you get up. Luckily for me the fall was into a sea of daisies 🌼,” King captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> photo on Wednesday, November 1, of himself in a field of flowers.</p><p>The reality star continued to fire back at the claims against him with a variety of hashtags, which read, “#iwascancelledbecauseofalie #anythingforaplatform #dontbelieveeverythingyousee #bullshitmedia #ivegotmyheadheldhigh #flowers #wakeupandsmelltheroses #worldisanuglyplace #iwouldneverdothat #belowdeck #belowdecksailing #onwardsandupwards”</p><p>King received subtle support from Glenn as the captain left two emojis: “👍😎 in the comments section.” King<a href=#> replied with a “love you” message</a> and Glenn wrote back “you too.”</p><p><strong>Ileisha Dell</strong>, who appeared alongside King <a href=#>on season 4 of the Below Deck spinoff</a>, also wrote to her costar that she loved his caption.</p><p>King later replied to a fan who asked whether he will appear at <a href=#>BravoCon</a>, which kicks off on Friday, November 3, adding, “That is a no :(.”</p><p>King <a href=#>was initially listed as part of the convention</a> when it was announced that the event was heading to Las Vegas. One month later, former Below Deck Sailing Yacht production assistant <a href=#><strong>Samantha Suarez</strong> accused King of making unwanted advances</a> while filming season 4 of the hit Bravo series, detailing their alleged interactions in a Rolling Stone exposé last month.</p><p>According to Suarez and other former employees who asked to remain anonymous, Bravo allegedly helped cover up King’s inappropriate behavior.</p><p>“It was insane. There were multiple incidents of sexual harassment in front of multiple producers after this person had been given verbal warnings multiple times,” one of the accusers claimed. “I had to promote and make this guy who just assaulted someone look awesome. That was my job, to make this person look cool, capable, and exciting.”</p><p>Suarez recalled being put in charge of King <a href=#>after he allegedly got drunk when filming wrapped</a> for the day. She kept an eye on him in his room before making an attempt to leave.</p><p>“[I said], ‘I have to go — I need to go bring other people water and food,’ and he’s like, ‘No, no, please,’” she recalled. “So I stepped into the room to set the case of waters down and again, he’s repeating, ‘Don’t leave,’ and I was like, ‘I have to go, I’m not staying.’”</p><p>King allegedly pressed himself against Suarez as she turned toward the door and refused to let her leave until she started to fight back. Suarez claimed she immediately alerted producers about the incident and King was subsequently told to sleep on the boat during “dark days” when the crew wasn’t filming as a way to keep him out of the hotel.</p><p>Bravo <a href=#>addressed the allegations in a statement</a> to Rolling Stone, stating, “Bravo is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful workplace for cast and crew on our reality shows. We require our third-party production companies to have appropriate workplace policies and trainings in place and a clear process on how to report concerns. The concerns Ms. Suarez raised in July 2022 were investigated at that time and action was taken based on the findings.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Below Deck’s production company, 51 Minds Entertainment, added in a separate statement: “51 Minds is committed to providing an environment in which every member of the casts and crews on our productions feel respected and, most importantly, safe. 51 Minds provides mandatory harassment and sensitivity training for every series it produces at the outset of each new season and lays out a clear process on how and to whom to report any questionable activity. With any complaint filed, a timely investigation is launched and, based on the findings, appropriate actions are implemented to ensure the safety of our cast and crew, up to and including termination. With regard to the incident reported by Ms. Suarez involving Mr. King, the case was investigated and reviewed as soon as it was submitted, and production acted accordingly based on the results.”</p><p>King denied the accusations in several Instagram comments in September, <a href=#>which have since been deleted</a>. “It’s so weird, it’s also so far from the truth. She always wanted a platform and unfortunately I’m the unlucky target,” he wrote one day after the report was published. “I’m not going to let some lying girl get to me… read that article fully, multiple times, and this happened to her on multiple seasons … seems odd.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During his return to social media on Wednesday, King continued to maintain his innocence. “I know [that I did nothing wrong], and I know the truth but it still hurts when people will tell lies to bring you down,” he replied to a fan who reminded King to stay positive amid the drama.</p><p>King’s costars are still expected to appear at BravoCon without him. Glenn, <a href=#><strong>Daisy Kelliher</strong>, <strong>Colin Macrae</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Alex Propson</strong> </a>are scheduled for panels throughout the weekend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZykxG6wxJyirGWXlr%2B6ecqipaBlopqwprXVnqpmm5GlwaK1zWaepZ2eo8Buv9Spp6iqpGKup8DEq2Ssm5GjsaK4jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbelow-decks-gary-king-receives-captain-glenns-support-after-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbelow-decks-gary-king-receives-captain-glenns-support-after-scandal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbelow-decks-gary-king-receives-captain-glenns-support-after-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbelow-decks-gary-king-receives-captain-glenns-support-after-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbelow-decks-gary-king-receives-captain-glenns-support-after-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbelow-decks-gary-king-receives-captain-glenns-support-after-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chang-hye-jin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chang-hye-jin.html>Chang Hye-jin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./annie-costner.html>Annie Costner estimated Net Worth, Age, Affairs, Height, Dating, Relationship Stats, Salary as well</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./annie-costner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
