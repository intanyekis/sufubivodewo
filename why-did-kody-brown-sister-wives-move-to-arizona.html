<time>18 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Kody Brown has made his fair share of decisions where viewers scratch their heads in disbelief or even disgust. <a href=#>Some of the decisions he may have wanted to keep under wraps</a> were it up to him. Be it from not giving each family equal time after marrying <a href=#>his favorite wife, Robyn Brown</a> to referring to his daughter Ysabel Brown's scoliosis surgery as a "vacation," lying about custody laws, and choosing to stay with Robyn and her family versus seeing his other kids, essentially not acting <a href=#>polygamous during the pandemic</a>, these are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to moments that fans consider cringe-worthy that have played out on Sister Wives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly enough, while fans were dumbfounded by Kody and had <a href=#>questions about </a><a href=#>Sister Wives</a> when he behaved in this manner, many were able to explain away what he did season after season by believing that perhaps he was not as bad as portrayed. Instead, fans believed (or even hoped) that Kody just made poor parenting choices. But after one decision that Kody made that was full of deceit and did not take into consideration anyone in his family but himself and Robyn, his popularity plummeted.</p><h2 id=kody-made-his-family-move-when-no-one-wanted-to>Kody Made His Family Move (When No One Wanted To)</h2><p>Part of what causes fans to come back to Sister Wives season after season is to see just how poorly Kody will behave. But in Season 12, even fans were taken aback when the reality star made the seemingly abrupt decision to uproot the family from Las Vegas to parcels of land in Flagstaff, Arizona.</p><p>Initially, it was unclear why Kody wanted to move the family from Las Vegas, where the kids had lives, friends, and were involved in activities that could set them up for college scholarships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But when two and two were put together, it was obvious that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kody was putting Robyn and her family above everyone else</a> when it was revealed that Dayton Brown was accepted to Northern Arizona University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kody-brown-sister-wives.jpg><p>"Their move was not a necessity, it was actually stupid and harmful," one Reddit user stated. Another agreed, writing, "It's definitely the lack of critical thinking that infuriates me."</p><p>"The move made no sense then and still makes no sense now," a third Reddit user explained. "The amount of money wasted on this move drives me crazy especially since the OG kids mentioned lack of food at periods of time growing up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further still, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the kids were aware that Kody was choosing to move to Arizona for Robyn</a>.</p><p>"I can’t speak toward dad [sic], but the thought of, ‘Hey, Flagstaff, Arizona, is a good place to move,’ does not exist," Paedon Brown explained. "Like there is no reason."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kody And Meri Brown Are Just Now Announcing Their Split, But They've Been Divorced For Years Already</a></span></p><p>"And then dad decides we’re gonna move the entire family ‘cause Dayton got accepted to NAU. And therefore, Robyn said, ‘Well I can’t let my little boy go.’ So, she told dad."</p><p>However, Paedon made it clear that it was not Dayton's choice to have the family follow him.</p><p>"Dayton had nothing to do with this," Paedon stated. "We did not get uprooted for Dayton, we got uprooted for dad’s favorite wife."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-the-browns-move-to-arizona>Why Did The Browns Move To Arizona?</h2><p>When it came time to get the wives on board with the move to Flagstaff from Las Vegas, there was only one sister wife who was on board from the get-go, and that was Robyn. As such, fans felt that manipulative moves were made to change Christine, Janelle, and Meri Brown's minds to ultimately get them to uproot their lives and move to Arizona.</p><p>"[Kody] and Robyn so obviously manipulated the rest of the wives," one Reddit user stated. "It's shameless. Watching it and knowing that Dayton is at college in AZ, you can see how they've made a plan to trick the other wives."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kody-brown-and-robyn-brown-on-sister-wives.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans also thought that Kody and the network worked together to manipulate the wives who did not want to move with the threat of the show being canceled. Because the money from the reality show is where the bulk of the yearly income came from, moving became the only choice for the family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sister Wives' Robyn Brown Is Taking The Blame For Kody's Poor Relationships With His Kids</a></span></p><p>"I always low-key thought the network and puddle monkey pressured them to move," a Reddit user explained. "The show was on the chopping block, I believe. Their pay had already been reduced at this point. A move would be DRAMA and viewers would return!"</p><p>If Christine, Meri, and Janelle would have had their ways, they would have either stayed in Las Vegas or moved to a state where there was family support.</p><h2 id=why-the-move-was-devastating-to-the-kids>Why The Move Was Devastating To The Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sister-wives-screenshot.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time that the Browns made the decision to move from Las Vegas to Flagstaff, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they apparently did not take any of the kids' feelings into consideration</a>. Given that they were not young kids, they were devastated to leave behind their friends, activities, and chances at college scholarships that were not afforded to them in Arizona.</p><p>"Those poor kids," one Reddit user stated. "The adults all kept saying that it was okay since they didn't have any seniors. News flash, transferring high schools for junior year sucks too and was completely unnecessary!"</p><p>Another user said, "I will never forget how devastated Gabe was. And how they explained away all his accomplishments and aspirations for the coming school year."</p><p>"Why couldn’t Janelle stay and sell the houses with the senior or Junior kids staying with her?" a third Reddit user asked. "This was all the most idiot thing this show ever did!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Viewers Are Anticipating This Crossover Following The End Of Kody Brown's Three Marriages</a></span></p><p>None of the kids had an issue with speaking out about not wanting to move. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">those who had a choice in the matter chose not to, to finish their studies at the University of Las Vegas</a>.</p><p>As such, both Aspyn and Logan Brown stayed behind in Sin City to complete their education versus trying to finish college closer to Flagstaff.</p><p>With much of the family making the move to live in different states these days, it appears that all the journey to Arizona did was break the family up and <a href=#>lead to failing marriages</a>. And with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors swirling that Dayton dropped out of college</a>, the whole reason for moving away from the family's comfortable life in Las Vegas may have been all for naught.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecqom7Jlkqe8uLqMrKCsrJWneri11Z6qZqWfq7JuwM5mmKuhqqS7ons%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-kody-brown-sister-wives-move-to-arizona.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-kody-brown-sister-wives-move-to-arizona.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-kody-brown-sister-wives-move-to-arizona.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-kody-brown-sister-wives-move-to-arizona.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-kody-brown-sister-wives-move-to-arizona.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-kody-brown-sister-wives-move-to-arizona.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-make-egg-stew-at-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-make-egg-stew-at-home.html>How To Make Egg Stew At Home</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./blake-tuomy-wilhoit.html>Blake Tuomy-Wilhoit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./blake-tuomy-wilhoit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
