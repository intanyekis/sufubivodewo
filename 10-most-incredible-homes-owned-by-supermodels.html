Indeed, for each working year the price a supermodel can put on his or her own face appearing in an advert could be triple compared to the previous year. So the big question is: what to spend it all on? Property is always a no-brainer; if you invest well in real-estate you have the opportunity to live comfortably for the rest of your life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you're bringing back your celebrity friends after a night out, holding a business dinner, entertaining family during the holidays or instagramming your latest home furnishings: you're going to want your home to be a reflection of your own wealth. Supermodels will hire a personal interior designer, be lavished with expensive freebies and invest in a housekeeping team that will always assure them everything will be looking perfect no matter when they walk through the door.</p><p>It's incredible to imagine that some of the names of this list gained such huge properties from pouting, runway-walking and looking damn hot in clothes. These ten extraordinary&nbsp;properties make you realise just how lucky these supermodels are...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-gisele-bundchen><strong>10. Gisele Bundchen&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When the world's highest-earning supermodel, <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a>, and NFL quarterback, <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>, got married - they combined an eye-watering wealth of $430 million. So it's&nbsp;no surprise that when it comes to real estate they have the pick of the grandest, most luxurious homes. Their Los Angeles mansion has&nbsp;six bedrooms, gourmet kitchen, library, gym, a huge pool and of course the home is surrounded by a koi-filled moat.</p><p>The 14,000 square-foot property is worth a staggering $50 million. Not content with having just the one super home; the couple are currently making plans to build yet another house for their large family to enjoy. Tom Brady told The Huffington Post last year:</p><p>“Gisele and I have eight sisters between us, and there are lots of kids. We built this house as a sanctuary for our family — a place where we can enjoy being together. It was important for us to plant roots for our family, and since we both enjoy the creative process, we decided to start from scratch."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-miranda-kerr><strong>9. Miranda Kerr</strong></h2><p>Australian supermodel, <a href=#>Miranda Kerr</a>, was separated from her husband&nbsp;<a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> two years ago and now lives the single life with her four-year-old son, Flynn, in Malibu. It's quite likely that Kerr has installed some top-of-the-range security as back in 2009 she was the target of the infamous Bling Ring who broke into her previous home and stole luxury goods including clothing and jewellery. The leader of the criminal group apparently wanted to get her hands on the model's&nbsp;expensive Victoria Secret lingerie collection.</p><p>Her new home with an ocean view is worth $2.1 million; the property includes 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. The home is perfect for Kerr as she keeps her jaw-dropping, firm-figure from hours of yoga practice each day. She said of her love for meditation:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it’s about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and my family and my health,' and now that I'm older I’ve added, ‘Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift my consciousness so that I can be the best version of myself."</p><p></p><h2 id=8-adriana-lima><strong>8. Adriana Lima</strong></h2><p>A tiny island in Miami, known as Indian Creek, is home to just 40 waterfront homes. This explains why only the wealthiest people live here: so hats off to <a href=#>Adriana Lima</a>, who bagged herself a mansion in one of the most exclusive locations in the US. The island itself is patrolled by police 24-hours a day, ensuring that only the most affluent of people step foot here.</p><p>Lima bought the home with her (then) husband, basketball player Marko Jarić, in 2009 and although it is one of the more modest homes on the island it still saw them cough up $9 million for the property. Originally built in 1958, the overall stretch of the estate is&nbsp;7,600-square-foot; so there's plenty of room for her two daughters Valentina and Sienna to run around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since she separated from Jarić in 2014 the house has been put on the market - with a large waiting list to get a spot on this island, there's no doubt they will land a quick, easy&nbsp;and very expensive&nbsp;sale.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-karlie-kloss><strong>7. Karlie Kloss</strong></h2><p>Imagine how lucky you would feel if your first home was a $2 million apartment in New York's West Village? Well, this is the life of luxury that <a href=#>Karlie Kloss</a> leads. The kitchen is large enough for her to work on the now famous recipe: Karlie's Kookies. The supermodel created the recipe for these chocolate and oat delights especially for DKNY's SoHo in-store charity benefit and she's become known on the&nbsp;fashion scene as being one talented baker.</p><p>Her wardrobe has 20 feet of space - plenty of room for all Kloss' Louboutins - and she has also spared no expense when it comes to decorating. Only a few months ago, the 6"1 star was spotted at an auction bidding $6,400 on an Ellsworth Kelly painting at the Prince George Ballroom in New York. Although she didn't win, it's clear she'll be back splashing some serious cash on arty pieces to compliment her stunning new home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-christie-brinkley><strong>6. Christie Brinkley&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Christie Brinkley</a> was the original inspiration behind her ex-husband <a href=#>Billy Joel</a>'s 1983 hit Uptown Girl; and she certainly lives&nbsp;her life in an uptown way. Her Caribbean home is situated on a private island in Parrot Cay which also boasts a mile-long private beach. The property, which stretches over one and a half acres, was bought for a grand total of $9 million; it has three bedrooms, a stunning ocean view as well as indoor and outdoor showers.</p><p>Tropical flowers and trees surround the home allowing the most picturesque privacy, but the dream home even came with a personal butler for all Brinkley's needs. This is the life you're expected to lead when you've been voted as one of the most attractive women of all time by several magazines including;&nbsp;Men’s Health, Playboy and Allure.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-kate-moss><strong>5. Kate Moss</strong></h2><p>After spending what must have felt like a lifetime partying it up in every major city in the world, supermodel <a href=#>Kate Moss</a> finally settled down in 2011 with her rocker husband Jamie Hince and her 13-year-old daughter Lila Grace. They all live together in a 10 bedroom, grade II listed mansion in the Cotswolds and she is currently awaiting permission to transform the surrounding land into a farm for herself to work on. It appears living the rural life has really transformed the world's most famous face.</p><p>The Cotswold's is one of the most sought-after locations in the British Countryside. Moss' neighbours include British prime-minister <a href=#>David Cameron</a>, <a href=#>Hugh Grant</a>, <a href=#>Elizabeth Hurley</a>, <a href=#>Jeremy Clarkson</a> and <a href=#>Lily Allen</a>. Moss' home is worth $2 million which is a very modest amount considering she is counted as the world's second highest paid model in the world - just behind <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a>.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-naomi-campbell><strong>4. Naomi Campbell</strong></h2><p>In 2012; <a href=#>Naomi Campbell</a>'s billionaire boyfriend, Russian entrepreneur Vladislav Doronin, built her a futuristic, bespoke home. Doronin was so&nbsp;set on bringing his supermodel girlfriend to his home country that to entice her further he built her a Star-Trek like dream home which has been labelled Capital Hill. The home is said to have its very own pool, spa, gym and Turkish bath for extreme pampering. The home is surrounded by a huge pine forest which secures the couples privacy.</p><p>In 2013, the model appeared in an advert to sell the homes with the intriguing line: "I listen to your heart, Moscow. Now you know where I stay." Alas, as is the case with most of Campbell's relationships the couple split after three years together and Doronin was added to the list of the supermodels ex's which includes: <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a>, <a href=#>Leonardo Di Caprio</a> and <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a>. You can build a model a luxury, future home but you just can't pin her down.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-claudia-schiffer><strong>3.&nbsp;Claudia Schiffer</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Claudia Schiffer</a> lives in a Grade I listed building known as Coldham Hall in Suffolk, England; which was originally built in 1574. Schiffer shares the home with her film producer husband <a href=#>Matthew Vaughn</a> and their three children; Caspar, Clementine and Cosima. The property boasts 12 bedrooms, 40 acres of land and a 600 yard driveway.</p><p>The stunning 16th-century mansion suffered a dramatic disaster when a huge fire swept through the $5 million property in May 2014 and it took a team of 50 firefighters to put out the fatal flames. A 35ft historic clock tower was destroyed completely during the two-hour long fight to save the home from complete destruction. Another unfortunate incident that happened at Coldham Hall&nbsp;was when an Italian kitchen porter was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after he constantly harassed Schiffer at her home; he believed the Pope had told him he was meant to marry the 5"11 German supermodel.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-cindy-crawford><strong>2. Cindy Crawford&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Cindy Crawford</a> is one of the luckiest women in the world; not only has she had an&nbsp;enviable modelling career but she can also call Los Cabos Mexico, which is situated on the southern tip of Mexico's Baja peninsula, her home. The best of it all? She can proudly say that her next door neighbour is none other than <a href=#>George Clooney</a>. Her luxurious home is furnished in Ralph Lauren. Outdoors, there is a fire pit made entirely from limestone imported from Spain and the pool overlooks the beach front.</p><p>Crawford lives with her husband, businessman <a href=#>Rande Gerber</a>, and their two children Presley and Kaia. Although her house is a place of absolute luxury, the supermodel also comments that she is not strict with the children at home:</p><p>"Our family room, where we live, is about togetherness and ease. Nothing in my house is too formal. There are no coasters on tables; the kids can eat Popsicles on the couch if they want to. I let them ride these little cycles we got for them when they were 3 that have rubber wheels and no pedals."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-heidi-klum><strong>1.&nbsp;Heidi Klum&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In 2014, <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> put her estate up for sale. The asking price? $25 million. Accompanied by its very own <a href=#>website</a> which has an extensive gallery displaying how decadent this home in the popular Brentwood Estate is,&nbsp;the 5ft 10" supermodel is waiting for one lucky buyer to take this mansion and grounds off her hands. She divorced singer <a href=#>Seal</a> in 2012. The couple had four children together.</p><p>Originally built in 1999, the home boasts 8 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a cinema room, infinity pool and a koi pond. If the lucky owner fancies a morning stroll, there is 8.5 acres of land which includes private hiking trails to keep them in shape just like Klum whose measurements are an enviable 32–24–34. In 2008 she was granted American citizenship while still maintaining her German citizenship so she could vote for <a href=#>President Obama</a> in the election.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ivLTAjKKlnKqVmbajuMRmn6illah6sMPNnptmmqliwLa8xKukqJyVocBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-most-incredible-homes-owned-by-supermodels.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-most-incredible-homes-owned-by-supermodels.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-most-incredible-homes-owned-by-supermodels.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-most-incredible-homes-owned-by-supermodels.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-most-incredible-homes-owned-by-supermodels.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-incredible-homes-owned-by-supermodels.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hassan-campbell-wikipedia-wife-lee-lee-and-kids-did-he-survive-murder-attempt-219532-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hassan-campbell-wikipedia-wife-lee-lee-and-kids-did-he-survive-murder-attempt-219532-html.html>Hassan Campbell Wikipedia Wife Lee Lee And Kids Did He Survive Murder Attempt?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-room-can-you-never-enter-riddle-169195.html>What Room Can You Never Enter?
