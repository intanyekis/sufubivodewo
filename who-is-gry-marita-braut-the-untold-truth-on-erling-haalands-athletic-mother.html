He joined the team in 2022. He has played for Red Bull Salzburg and Borussia Dortmund in the past. He is also a member of the Norwegian National Team.</p><figure id=attachment_59741 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59741 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Erling Haaland</figure><h2>Who is Gry Marita Braut, the mother of Erling Haaland?</h2><p>Gry Marita Braut was born in Norway in the middle of the 1970s. She is in her forties and her family is from Norway.</p><p>Braut is an athlete who has won the heptathlon in his home country of Norway. Gry Marita Braut won the heptathlon for Norway and was the country’s representative. She did track and field, which was a sport with seven events.</p><p>Gry took part in the heptathlon, which includes the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-meter run, long jump, javelin throw, and 800-meter run.</p><p>The fact that his mother is a 21-year-old track and field athlete who competes in the heptathlon may have also helped him become a good athlete.</p><h2>Erling Haaland’s father was a football player and his mother was an athlete</h2><p>Erling Haaland’s father, Alfie Haaland, played football, and his mother, Gry Marita Braut, was also an athlete.</p><p>On July 21, 2002, in Bryne, Norway, the Norwegian striker played his first game for his country. Alfie Haaland’s father was a famous and good defender who played for Manchester City, Leeds United, and Nottingham Forest.</p><p>Alfie is happy to see that his son is also a well-known athlete like his father. The man who gave birth to Haaland was a good athlete.</p><h2>Haaland’s mother gave him the genes for sports</h2><p>The football player got his love of the game from his father and his speed and agility from his mother. Erling, the mother, played many different sports. His mother, Gry, was a track and field athlete who took part in heptathlons throughout her career.</p><h2>Erling’s family is made up of athletes who play football and other sports</h2><p>Erling’s brother Astor doesn’t work in the sports industry. His dad and his cousins Jonatan Braut Brunes and Albert Thailand are all athletes, as is the rest of his family.</p><h2>Who Are the Children of Gry Marita Braut?</h2><p>Erling is the most well-known child of his parents, even though he has two other siblings. Gabrielle “Gabi” Haaland is his younger sister, and Astor Haaland is his older brother.</p><p>Even though he played football a lot, so did his siblings. Other stories say that when they were young, his older brother Astor played football, but he never got good enough to play for a professional team.</p><p>The other children of the football player’s parents live more quiet lives. Even so, they are known because they have been in a few of Erling’s games.</p><p>Gabrielle is very optimistic like her brother, and she likes to push her body to its limits. Because of this, she likes to go on vacation, go hiking, and do other things for fun. She also served in the military at different times in her life.</p><h2>More About the Husband of Gry Marita Braut</h2><p>Alfie Haaland was a player for the Premier League team Nottingham Forest when Braut married him in the middle of the 1990s. He was with Braut in England.</p><p>Erling, Gabrielle, and Astor Haaland are the three children they have as a family. Her oldest son, Astor, is going to the BI Norwegian Business School to get his Master’s in Finance.</p><p>Gabrielle Braut Haaland is her daughter. She is married to Jan Gunnar Eide and has a child with him. Erling is the youngest of them all, and he gets paid to play football.</p><p>Erling Haaland, the oldest son of Braut Haaland, just played his first game in the Premier League for Manchester City. Before that, he played for Borussia Dortmund. He is thought to be one of the smartest young people.</p><h2>What age is Gry Marita Braut right now?</h2><p>Gry Marita Braut and her husband are about the same age. Right now, her husband Alfie is 49 years old.</p><p>She was born in Norway and had Norwegian citizenship, which is something that everyone knows. Her past and early career are not online, which is a shame.</p><p>Genetically, Albert Braut Brunes, Jonathan, and Emma are all related to Gry. All three are Norwegian football players, and Albert has played for the 2021 Norway U17 team and other football teams.</p><p>Erling, who is 5 years old and the son of Alfie and Gry, jumped 1.63 meters while standing still. As of the time this was written, the record, which was set by a 5-year-old, was still in place.</p><h2>Marita Braut was an athlete who did the heptathlon</h2><p>Gry Marita Braut was the person from Norway who won the heptathlon. She also took part in track and field, a sport with seven events.</p><p>Since she takes part in the heptathlon, you should be able to understand it better. Each woman who competes in this sport does so on a total of seven different tracks and fields. Gry took part in the Heptathlon, which consisted of the 100-meter hurdles, the high jump, the shot put, the 200-meter run, the long jump, the javelin throw, and the 800-meter run.</p><p>Erling Haaland’s parents were both professional athletes at some point in his life, so he got his athletic personality from them. Because of the heptathlon, Gry became well-known.</p><p>The sporty boy, like his mother, played golf, handball, and track and field. Haaland also took part in the Heptathlon and the game of football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1663310048_84_Who-Is-Gry-Marita-Braut-The-Untold-Truth-On-Erling.png><h2>Marita Braut’s son, Erling Haaland, grew up during the Gry years</h2><p>Erling’s older brother, Astor, reminded him of many things from when he was a boy. Now, he puts all of this together to make his best childhood memories. You may have been confused about why he wore a Man City shirt. From 2000 to 2003, his father, Alf-Inge Rasdal Holland, played for that team.</p><p>Erling Halland’s older brother, Astor, wasn’t the only one of his family members. Gabrielle Haaland, who was his older sister, also went to the house where he grew up. Erling had a great relationship with them as siblings.</p><p>He used to be very active and have a big smile when he was younger. When he smiles like a Cheshire cat, he remembers all the good times he had with Astor and Gabrielle when he was young.</p><p>In 2004, Erling Haaland’s family left England because of a terrible event (see below for more information). When his parents moved back to Bryne, Norway, where they grew up, he was 3 years old. He grew up here for the rest of his childhood.</p><h2>Erling Haaland Net Worth In 2022</h2><p>According to the website goal.com, Haaland had a net worth of about £9 million ($12 million).</p><p>When Haaland joined Bundesliga powerhouse Dortmund in December 2019, he signed a contract for four and a half years. During a memorable run with BVB, new terms for him have been talked about, but no deal has been reached to make sure that top teams in Europe will still be very interested in him.</p><p>Haaland reportedly signed a contract when he joined Dortmund that pays him £ 132,000 per week, or just over £6.8 million ($9 million) a year.</p><p>When he first started getting famous at Molde, people thought that he only made £60 a week, and it only went up to £20,000 at Red Bull Salzburg.</p><h2>Early Career of Erling Haaland</h2><p>Haaland signed with Red Bull Salzburg of the Austrian Bundesliga in January 2019. He had just won two league titles and one Austrian Cup. He signed with Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga in December 2019.
