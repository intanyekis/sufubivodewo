Then, finally, his mother saved up money for months to buy him the first pair of skates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gordie-howe-young.jpg><p>With some neighborhood friends, Gordie would play tennis ball outdoors.
