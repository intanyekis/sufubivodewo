At least, there's nothing more beloved than Chip and Joanna Gaines' Fixer Upper series, including its spinoffs. The couple's wholesome image helps support the series, and the fact that they're parents of five kids is also a point for the pair. Yet not everything is what it seems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Some have accused Chip and Joanna of being "hateful,"</a> while there have been <a href=#>rumblings about the quality of the pair's home renovations</a>. And when it comes right down to it, not everyone is convinced that Chip and Joanna Gaines are good at their jobs—or good for their local community.</p><h2 id=chip-and-joanna-gaines-operate-magnolia-homes-out-of-waco-texas>Chip And Joanna Gaines Operate Magnolia Homes Out Of Waco, Texas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fixer-Upper-2-via-photos.hgtv_.com_.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chip and Joanna Gaines started their company, Magnolia</a>, in 2003. The couple launched in Waco, Texas and many of their projects happen in their local area.</p><p>For many years, the Gaines family has served as a pillar of their community, though neither was actually born or raised there. Still, the couple is credited with giving parts of the community a face lift, as their designs and home renovations have bolstered the real estate market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Chip And Joanna Gaines Raise Their 5 Kids">How Chip And Joanna Gaines Raise Their 5 Kids</a></span></p><p>Of course, some also blame the Gaineses for inflating the local housing market, making it impossible for people who have grown up there to purchase a home and stick around.</p><p>That's only the beginning of the controversy, though, with critics saying <a href=#>there are many things the public ignores about the Gaineses</a>.</p><h2 id=some-waco-locals-claim-the-gaines-family-is-only-helping-themselves>Some Waco Locals Claim The Gaines Family Is Only Helping Themselves</h2><p>Many people who claim to live in Waco, Texas <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disagree with the assumption</a> that "the people of Waco love Chip and Jo for all that they do for the community."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One commenter simply called them a "scam," noting that their spouse is a framing carpenter and finds some of their remodels appalling. That same commenter claimed their aunt was on the show Fixer Upper, and that the property was left "all kinds of [messed] up" afterward.</p><p>Another person shared their friends' experience making an offer on a Chip-and-Jo-renovated home; the friends "backed out because it had substandard wiring that wouldn't pass their FHA loan inspection," the person wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Joanna And Chip Gaines: How Did They Amass Their Incredible Net Worth?">Joanna And Chip Gaines: How Did They Amass Their Incredible Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>After they backed out, the friend said, Chip Gaines "was SCREAMING at them in the front yard of the house" for refusing to use the Gaines' inspector. What's worse, the person claimed that the folks who eventually bought the house "had to move out after the kids tested off the charts high for lead and the lead abatement cost $$$$ and took forever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from structural and other issues with renovations, many say that Chip and Joanna are not nice to interact with, whether informally in Waco or formally in business dealings.</p><p>One shared a story about Joanna being rude while they were dining at Magnolia. Another said Joanna was a bit snooty when her kids were getting haircuts in town.</p><p>Yet another stated that Chip was "sharp" when it came to business dealings, but suggested that he often lawyered up to avoid doing what was, according to the commenter, the right or legal thing in a situation.</p><p>But are Chip and Joanna really impacting people's lives in Waco, Texas?</p><h2 id=are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-making-waco-living-worse>Are Chip And Joanna Gaines Making Waco Living Worse?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Chip-Joanna.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The tea doesn't stop there from purported Waco locals. Other commenters noted that most of Waco isn't happy with the Gaines or Magnolia, and weren't before the couple became famous and netted their reality show.</p><p>One person wrote, "They were crooks and rude before they even had the show, and only got worse once they got it." They went on to explain that local vendors, pre-Fixer Upper, had to wait forever to get paid and that the homes that Chip and Joanna renovated "would always have major issues with them."</p><p>That person didn't give any specific details, but stated that "Their legal issues have been in the news and are open record."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Believe Chip & Joanna Gaines Need To Fixer Upper Their Marriage">Fans Believe Chip & Joanna Gaines Need To Fixer Upper Their Marriage</a></span></p><p>Another apparent local said they knew people that interacted with Chip and Joanna pre-2013, and that "I don’t know of anyone who particularly trusts them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many other commenters agreed that the cost of living rose starkly after Magnolia took over the city, and blamed the Gaineses for trying to "get rid of" the Salvation Army, among other slights.</p><p>Multiple people lamented not being able to afford a home in the area, calling it "gentrification" at its finest.</p><p>One person summed up, "They have done alot more bad than good and people think they help the city so much but they really don't."</p><p>Ultimately, the general assumption is that people living in Waco don't love Chip and Joanna Gaines, whether due to bad business deals, garbage home renovations, or simply steep housing costs.</p><p>As one person noted flatly, "So, yeah, we hate Magnolia. It’s also a tradition to flip off the Magnolia billboards."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYycn6KoXZa7pXnJqJinppFitKK1zZ6qZqqVlrmtxYyloKSdXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-really-like.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-really-like.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-really-like.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-really-like.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-really-like.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-really-like.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./belinda-carlisle-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./belinda-carlisle-net-worth.html>Belinda Carlisle Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sneaker-life-these-are-the-most-expensive-sneakers-owned-by-chris-brown.html>Sneaker Life: These Are The Most Expensive Sneakers Owned By Chris Brown</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sneaker-life-these-are-the-most-expensive-sneakers-owned-by-chris-brown.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
