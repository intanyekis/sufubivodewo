His presence in The Real Housewives reality franchise has brought him into the homes of millions each week. <a href=#>He is also the co-host of CNN's New Year's broadcast</a> with Anderson Cooper each year.</p><p>Cohen's most famous position, however, has been as host of Watch What Happens Live. Cohen's style of interviewing celebrities has led to many viral moments. The many famous faces who sit down with Cohen find themselves revealing things they otherwise wouldn't discuss.</p><p>However, there is one celebrity Cohen still hasn't been able to book on Watch What Happens Live. Cohen recently spoke to <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> about this celebrity and why he gave up trying to make the appearance happen.</p><h2 id=andy-told-howard-stern-that-madonna-still-hasn-39-t-been-on-39-watch-what-happens-live-39>Andy Told Howard Stern That Madonna Still Hasn't Been On 'Watch What Happens Live'</h2><p>In 2023, Cohen appeared on The Howard Stern Show to promote his latest book "The Daddy Diaries: The Year I Grew Up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the chat, Cohen discussed his gig as a host on Watch What Happens Live. While Cohen has interviewed many famous faces, Stern pointed out the fact that Madonna still hasn't appeared on the show. When asked how he felt about this, Cohen said he'd given up trying to book her as a guest.</p><p>"Madonna still has not done the show," Cohen said. "I'm actually kind of over it because in my Notes app, I was keeping a long list of interview questions for her in case she ever did the show, and she's kind of answered a lot of it."</p><p>Cohen also revealed a text exchange he had with the Queen of Pop, which might reveal why she hasn't appeared on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've mellowed about it. She and I have been in touch a little bit over the years," Cohen said. "A couple years ago, I reached out to her and said, 'Anderson [Cooper] and I are coming to see you tonight.' She was doing a special surprise performance for something."</p><p>He continued, "She said to me 'Stop having people trash me on your show.'"</p><p>Cohen admitted he was surprised by Madonna's reaction, because he is overwhelmingly positive about her on the show. He told Madonna that only the few bad moments from another guest get picked up and blown out of proportion by the media. He said since Madonna has dealt with this herself, she should understand.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cybill-shepherd-had-an-unexpected-and-awkward-interaction-with-madonna-during-her-live-today-show-interview-front-back_deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Cybill Shepherd Had An Unexpected And Awkward Interaction With Madonna During Her Live Today Show Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The actress decided to approach Madonna as she walked past her dressing room while live on the "Today Show."</span><p>"I speak so positively — on the radio and Watch What Happens Live.

In 2017, Patti Lupone, who starred in the stage version of Evita, called Madonna a "movie killer." A year prior, Benjamin Bratt, who starred alongside Madonna in The Next Best Thing, insinuated that she was a bad actress.</p><h2 id=madonna-called-out-andy-on-stage-during-one-of-her-recent-concerts>Madonna Called Out Andy On Stage During One Of Her Recent Concerts</h2><p>In 2023, Madonna kicked off her "Celebration Tour" to celebrate her four decades in the music business.</p><p>When she brought the tour to Brooklyn's Barclays Center, she had a little fun with Cohen, who was in attendance that night.</p><p>"If you say one more bad thing about me on your show, you’re gonna get in so much trouble," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna told him from the stage</a>. "You little troublemaking queen!"</p><p>As Madonna jokingly reprimanded him, Cohen was seen mouthing "I love you" to the singer. He later shared his reaction to the moment on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’m a life-long Madonna fan, so it’s a thrill and an honor to be called a 'troublemaking queen' by the Queen of Troublemaking," he wrote, also sharing a montage of several moments where he praised her on Watch What Happens Live.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar46162487.jpg><p>This wouldn't be the first time Madonna had some fun with one of her celebrity fans on stage. In 2015, she shared a memorable moment with Cohen's friend Anderson Cooper during her "Rebel Heart Tour" at the same venue.</p><p>During the show, she performed a song which involved her inviting someone from the audience to join her on stage. Sometimes the special guest would be a fan, but a lot of celebrities who happened to attend the concerts would also get the honor of dancing with the Queen of Pop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/untitled-design-48.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Anderson Cooper Was Brought On Stage By Madonna Mid-Concert And His Dancing Skills Turned Out To Be A Complete Mess</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The CNN journalist has been friends with the Queen of Pop for many years.</span><p>When the tour made its way to the Barclays Center, Cooper was the special guest Madonna decided to invite on stage.</p><p>"I've been dancing with him at nightclubs," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna said on Live with Kelly and Ryan in 2017</a>, "and he's a good dancer.

In his book "The Andy Cohen Diaries: A Deep Look at a Shallow Year," Cohen recalled the time he surprisingly saw Madonna flying on the same commercial flight as him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cohen said a flight attendant told him they were more excited to see him on the flight than Madonna. At that moment, Cohen was thrilled to learn Madonna was on the same flight as him and searched for her. Cohen was surprised to find her in an ordinary window seat and Madonna told him she would "come up front to see him later."</p><p>Cohen texted her and said that he was surprised to find her flying commercial and not in first class. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna replied</a>, "I do it all the time.
