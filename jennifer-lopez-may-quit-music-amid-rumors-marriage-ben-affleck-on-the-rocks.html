The rumors started when the pair were spotted having what seemed to be a heated exchange while on vacation, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the following explanations from a source</a> didn't help their case. "Ben wanted this vacation to be relaxing but Jennifer’s up at 6 a.m. dictating their schedule," the source explained. "She's extremely picky about everything, from maid service to where to eat dinner. Sometimes Ben can't hide his annoyance, and that’s what people were seeing in St. Barts." Work is also apparently something that causes a lot of strain in their relationship, as things have reportedly been tense between them on the set of their movie Unstoppable: The Anthony Robles Story. "They’re both under a lot of pressure to dispel the notion that together they’re box-office poison," the source added. "They have a lot riding on this, and Jennifer is obsessed with every detail and has been bothering Ben." If work is one of the reasons their marriage is suffering, that might be one of the reasons why Jennifer is considering quitting music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even so, it doesn't seem Ben and Jennifer want to stop trying, as they clearly love each other, and if taking a break from working is what they need, it's worth considering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylpqmdqmK6osWMqqyirF2iwrS1wmaYpqGUYr%2B2uc6rqmalkae%2Fqq3GnmSbnZ5irqeyy56apGWfo3q1tMRmqaibm6h8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-lopez-may-quit-music-amid-rumors-marriage-ben-affleck-on-the-rocks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjennifer-lopez-may-quit-music-amid-rumors-marriage-ben-affleck-on-the-rocks.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-may-quit-music-amid-rumors-marriage-ben-affleck-on-the-rocks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjennifer-lopez-may-quit-music-amid-rumors-marriage-ben-affleck-on-the-rocks.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-may-quit-music-amid-rumors-marriage-ben-affleck-on-the-rocks.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-may-quit-music-amid-rumors-marriage-ben-affleck-on-the-rocks.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robert-irvine-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-275983-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robert-irvine-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-275983-html.html>Robert Irvine Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jeanene-fox-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-326293-html.html>Jeanene Fox Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jeanene-fox-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-326293-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
