As a human we must live each day with a purpose or else we will be caught in a haze of daily activities. I decided to write a bucket list; a simple list filled with countless things I NEED to do before I die. Life is unpredictable, tomorrow I can cross the street, be hit by a car and be gone. That is why you need to live in the "now." There is so much to do in a lifetime and each person has dreams and goals. I decided to write a piece in hopes of inspiring people to create their own personal bucket list and follow through with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following 20 things are suggestions that everyone should try in their life (although there is so much more I could have put). Every person is different however; the following array of things touches on different levels of life. The world&nbsp;is&nbsp;an incredible place and we as humans do not know what we did to end up here or what the purpose of being here even is. That is why everyone should live life the way they see fit. You are only given one chance on this earth, so make sure you experience everything you want and don’t let anyone or anything ever hold you back.</p><h2 id=20-skydive><strong>20. Skydive</strong></h2><p>Skydiving is one of those activities everyone should do at least once in their lives. There is something about being so close to dying that makes a person feel alive. Although the thought of jumping out of a plane is frightening, it is something that you won’t regret doing. This is a great activity to do with friends, alone or with a significant other. Regardless who you do it with, you will cherish the moment and never forget what it felt like to jump out of an airplane. It is a rush and a high like you will never experience and should be added to everybody’s bucket list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=19-dance-in-the-rain><strong>19. Dance in the Rain</strong></h2><p>We live in a world where we are supposed to follow a “proper” conduct. Our parents, teachers and peers set unwritten rules which we are expected to follow, such as: be clothed when leaving our house and make sure you&nbsp;have shoes one. One rule in specific is to use an umbrella when it rains (to not catch a cold). Although this makes sense, one day in your life, break that rule. Dance around, feel the moist soil in between your toes, sing at the top of your lungs. By letting go of your inhibitions you will feel like a child again and that is a beautiful feeling.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-attend-burning-man-festival><strong>18. Attend Burning Man Festival</strong></h2><p>Via abcnews.go.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I am sure you have all heard of Burning Man, but do you know why it is so cool? Well, lucky for you, I am about to tell you. Burning Man is the biggest and weirdest party on the planet. With over 60,000 people camping in the Nevada desert it is sure to be an unforgettable experience. The desert is filled with incredible art instillations and has numerous workshops including yoga, improv and knife throwing. This annual party is dedicated to major exercises of self-expression and self-reliance. There are so many more reasons to go to Burning Man, however it is not as easy as it looks. Make sure to research it thoroughly before attending just in case it's not for you.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-find-a-charity-to-give-back-to><strong>17. Find a Charity to Give Back to</strong></h2><p>When talking about giving back to a charity, most people automatically think about donating money. Although that is always an incredible and kind gesture, the most rewarding feeling is giving your time. Everyone should get involved in a charity at one point in their lives, whether you work with the poor or with those who are sick, giving your time to a charity is both beneficial and rewarding to yourself. This is definitely a selfless act everyone should do at least one day in your&nbsp;life. Not only will you feel good about yourself, it is also a great experience and looks great on your resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=16-own-a-pet><strong>16. Own a Pet</strong></h2><p>Pets are probably the best purchase you will ever make. Personally, I am a dog person. I adore my dogs, I believe it gives us a sense of both empathy and responsibility. Having a pet is having another living creature to keep alive, which can be difficult when you feel like you are barely living. It has been proven that animals, especially dogs and cats, can be very therapeutic. If you really want to do something special and create an incredible bond with your animal, adopt a rescue. Rescue dogs are in need of loving families and if you are able to take on the responsibility of a pet, you should consider a rescue. All this to say is that you should absolutely own a pet at one point of your lifetime.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-run-a-marathon><strong>15. Run a Marathon</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is something I personally have always wanted to do but have always been too intimidated to try. Running a marathon takes discipline, hard work and of course incredible stamina. Running a marathon not only has physical and mental benefits, it is an unforgettable experience. There is something satisfying about accomplishing something that once seemed so out of reach. This is definitely something you won't regret doing. Running a marathon is a great experience and it is a great way of getting into incredible shape. Check what marathons take place near you and go for it. Like I said before, you will not regret doing it.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-be-a-member-of-a-tv-audience><strong>14. Be a Member of a TV&nbsp;Audience</strong></h2><p>Have you ever watched a talk show like Jerry Springer and wondered what it would be like to be there? Everyone has that one show they can't live without and for many, daily shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live or The Ellen Degeneres Show&nbsp;are what helps them get through the day. There are so many shows that film in front of a live audience, even sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory. By being a member of a live audience you will experience television from an entirely new perspective. This is something everyone, especially every television lover, should experience. Although tickets are often hard to obtain, where there is a will, there is a way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-live-in-a-different-country><strong>13. Live in a Different Country</strong></h2><p>Living in a different country is very different from traveling to a different country. Although it may be a scary thought, moving away from home, even if it is just for a few months, is something everyone should do in his or her lifetime. By living in a foreign country you open yourself up to experiences you never thought were possible. You will have the opportunity to meet and learn from people you never would have met otherwise. This will also help you gain personal and global perspective. Moving abroad will not always be easy, however through your hardships you will experience growth in a way you never thought imaginable.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-learn-a-foreign-language><strong>12. Learn a Foreign Language</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Learning a language may seem extremely intimidating at first, but it is something everyone should do. Whether you want to connect with your roots or learn more about a culture, learning languages is something that is very beneficial. Learning a foreign language actually boosts brainpower and can improve memory. It helps with self-discovery. By embarking on a new challenge you are allowing your mind to experience something it never has before. As previously mentioned, moving to a different country is something everyone should do, so if you are moving somewhere with&nbsp;a different native language, it would be a great idea to learn it!</p><p></p><h2 id=11-backpack-through-at-least-5-locations><strong>11. Backpack Through at Least 5 Locations</strong></h2><p>Backpacking is an incredible and affordable way of travelling. Free spirits from around the world embark on these journeys and it has becoming more and more popular. Most people backpack for the experience and adventure that comes with the voyage. Backpacking is definitely something to try at least once in your lifetime; it is an opportunity of discovering the world in a way you have never experienced. There are nice hostels and friendly people in almost every country, it's just a matter of opening yourself up to new experiences and taking the first step in embracing them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-conquer-a-fear><strong>10. Conquer a Fear</strong></h2><p>Everyone in this world is afraid of something, and most people are afraid of more than one thing. It is understandable that throughout your life, there are certain fears that won’t be conquered, however there are also certain fears that can be conquered. By conquering a fear you are opening yourself up to new horizons. To overcome your fears you must get to know yourself, think about the benefits of overcoming the fear and take action. Facing your fears and conquering them is extremely rewarding, you will thank yourself when it is over. Everyone should face their fears before they die, why not&nbsp;conquer them at the same time.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-donate-your-hair><strong>9. Donate Your Hair</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone can donate hair and everyone should. It doesn’t matter if it's dyed, it can be used to make a wig for someone battling cancer. There is something extremely rewarding about doing something so simple, yet it has the power to affect&nbsp;people in such powerful ways. People who lose their hair often suffer from low self-esteem and with all they are going through, they should at least feel beautiful. For someone with long hair, it is a beautiful gift you can give. Remember, hair grows back, but for some it is a lot harder than others. There are numerous organizations that accept hair from individuals who want to help those who are suffering from both short and long term hair loss.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-bury-a-time-capsule-and-open-it><strong>8. Bury a Time Capsule (And&nbsp;Open It)</strong></h2><p>This is something we always see on television or in movies. Burying a time capsule involves&nbsp;you and your friends (or you alone) burying a box filled with moments and memories. You can write a letter to your future self or even put items that you think may be completely extinct in the future like a VHS or a mix tape. Set a date with whoever you buried it with, but make it more than five years from the date of the burial. This is something you will never forget; it is a way of holding on to your past without even realizing it. If you are going to do this (which I suggest you do), I advise you to bury it somewhere safe, like in your parents' backyard or a special spot you and your friends share.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-go-scuba-diving-or-snorkelling><strong>7. Go Scuba Diving or Snorkelling</strong></h2><p>Humans spend our lives entirely on land; however, there is an entire world in the ocean. 71% of the earth’s surface is actually ocean (crazy, I know). With snorkelling and scuba diving you are given the opportunity to get up close and personal with marine life. There is so much about the sea that we do not know and it is so different from land, so learning and experiencing marine life is an incredible experience that everyone should want to do. To be able to see and learn about sea creature and life in the ocean is truly a privilege that we as humans are fortunate to have.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-go-skiing><strong>6. Go Skiing</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For some people, skiing is a weekend activity during the winter, but for a lot of people skiing is something they are dying to try. There is something fascinating about being able to glide on snow while being in control of your movements. Skiing is a beautiful sport that is a lot of fun however; it is not exactly super safe. You should take a lesson before ever attempting to ski on your own, but it is worth trying out especially for those who live in hot climates. Skiing is a great activity that everyone should try throughout his or her life. If skiing is too “boring” for you, you can always try snowboarding, which is a bit more difficult.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-give-blood><strong>5. Give Blood</strong></h2><p>Did you know that by giving blood you can be the difference between life and death? This is something everyone (who is able) should do in his or her life, it is so very important. I understand that some people are squeamish, however it is a sacrificial act that will leave you feeling good about yourself. Our society focuses on the wrong things and this is a way of doing something that really matters. There are also benefits to giving blood, not only will you get a mini “check-up,” your iron levels will stay balanced and your blood may even flow better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-go-to-disney-world><strong>4. Go to Disney World</strong></h2><p>Via today.com</p><p>This may sound cliché but everyone should visit a Disney park as an adult. When you are a child, you believe Disney&nbsp;World&nbsp;to be this magical place, however when you go as an adult you realize it is a magical place. Disney World really is the happiest place on earth. Many of you may believe that it's just for kids but that is far from true. There are countless activities for adults to do, making this an ideal getaway to experience&nbsp;at one point in your adult life. There is no age limit on having fun, nor is there an age limit on experiencing the magic of Disney.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-fall-in-love><strong>3. Fall in Love</strong></h2><p>As cheesy as it may sound, love is very powerful. A lot of people believe that love can only be found within a relationship. I believe everyone in the world has the potential to be&nbsp;someone’s great love. However, in the society in which we live in, people tend to love their cell phones more than the people around them. Falling in love does not always need to be between two people. Fall in love with your city, fall in love with everything around you and most importantly, fall in love with yourself. It is important to peel your eyes away from your cell phones and focus on how incredible life truly is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-visit-all-seven-continents><strong>2. Visit All Seven&nbsp;Continents</strong></h2><p>Traveling is probably the best form of education in the world. It is a way of understanding, respecting and learning about cultures that differ from yours. Before you die, you should try and visit all seven continents and as many countries within those continents as possible. By traveling you are not only broadening your horizons, you are growing as a person. By traveling to places far away and leaving your comfort zone, you will not only learn about culture, people and history but you will also learn so much about yourself. The world is a big, beautiful place and it is yours to discover.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-follow-your-dreams><strong>1. Follow Your Dreams</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Do you want to look back at your life when you are old and grey and realize you didn’t do anything you wanted to do in life? We as humans get so preoccupied with the future that we forget to focus on the present. Although getting an education and securing a job is great, it is not the same thing as following your passion, unless you are lucky enough to study and work in a field you are passionate about. Every person has his or her own journey and every journey is different, it is up to you to figure out what your journey is. Live the life you want and lead a life that makes you happy, that will be your greatest achievement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6Bif3F506Ggp5%2BjYsawwYymrKysXZm8bq7En6arnV2uvLZ5w6KcaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-20-things-you-must-do-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-20-things-you-must-do-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-20-things-you-must-do-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-20-things-you-must-do-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-20-things-you-must-do-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-20-things-you-must-do-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./devanne-villarreal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./devanne-villarreal.html>American Beautician, Devanne Villarreal &amp;amp; Her Husband, Davante Adams' Joyful Married Life; Shares A</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-top-10-most-expensive-sweet-16-parties.html>Most Expensive Sweet 16 Parties</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-top-10-most-expensive-sweet-16-parties.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
