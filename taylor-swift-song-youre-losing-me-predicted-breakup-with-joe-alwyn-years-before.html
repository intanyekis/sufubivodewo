The <a href=#><strong>musician</strong></a> dated Alwyn for six years, during which time he contributed to several of her albums and served as the inspiration behind countless love songs.</p><p>Swift and Alwyn's relationship officially ended in April 2023, but astute fans have pointed out that a song thought to be about Alwyn was actually written earlier than was originally believed. So much earlier, in fact, that it puts the romance between the pop superstar and the actor in a completely different context.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-quot-you-39-re-losing-me-quot-may-have-been-written-during-relationship-issues-with-ex-boyfriend-joe-alwyn>Taylor Swift's "You're Losing Me" May Have Been Written During Relationship Issues With Ex-Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</h2><p>Jack Antonoff dropped a bomb on the Taylor Swift fanbase when he revealed the origin of the song "You're Losing Me." The song was widely believed to have been penned towards the end of the 'Midnights' sessions in 2022, given how the sad lyrics aligned with the sudden dissolution of Swift's relationship with Joe Alwyn in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joe-alwyn-in-an-interview.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Looking Back, Fans Are Not Impressed With Joe Alwyn's Treatment Of Taylor Swift In Interviews">Looking Back, Fans Are Not Impressed With Joe Alwyn's Treatment Of Taylor Swift In Interviews</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Is saying nothing as bad as saying negative things about a partner? Fans think so when it came to Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift.</p><p>Well, it turns out that the opposite was true. Instead of being written towards the end of the 'Midnights' season, "You're Losing Me" was an early song that dates back to December 2021. Antonoff spilled the beans (or rather, the raisins) in an Instagram Story meant to celebrate the song's belated streaming debut:</p><p>"'You're Losing Me' is out today. A very special track from the Midnight's sessions that's finally streaming! Written and recorded at home on 12/5/21 right after Taylor ate these raisins."</p><p>The period in which the song was written means that Swift and Alwyn were experiencing problems months before they were initially reported. For context, the first time that Swift talked about the stress that tabloids place on her relationship was in May 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-uk.jpg><p>She explained the meaning of the song "Lavender Haze" on Instagram and alluded to the fact that things had not been going as smoothly as they seemed from the outside.</p><p>“I guess, when you’re in the lavender haze, you’ll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud... We’ve had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff."</p><p>Now that the December 2021 date has been confirmed for "You're Losing Me", however, fans can ascertain that Swift wasn't comfortable sharing her personal problems with fans until after the release of Midnights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-you-39-re-losing-me-quot-addresses-the-rumor-that-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-were-engaged>"You're Losing Me" Addresses The Rumor That Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Were Engaged</h2><p>"You're Losing Me" contains multiple references to Joe Alwyn, despite never mentioning him by name. Some of the most concrete lyrical references include:</p><ul><li>"Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?"</li><li>"How long could we be a sad song?"</li><li>"I'm the best thing at this party / and I wouldn't marry me either."</li></ul><p>The first is the most self-explanatory, in that it alludes to the six years that Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn spent together, and the lives they built. The second lyric is a more pointed reference to an interview that Swift gave to Apple Music in 2020. During said interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she discussed her writing process with Alwyn</a>, and how the two of them are typically drawn to sad songs over happy ones:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Joe and I really love sad songs. He's always just playing instruments, and he doesn't do it in a strategic, 'I'm writing a song right now' thing. He's always done that. We’ve always bonded over music. We write the saddest songs. We just really love sad songs. What can I say?"</p><p>The third lyric has become the most compelling for fans to analyze. Swift had written about marriage in the past, and the frequency with which it was brought up in her music escalated when she was dating Alwyn. She talks about wanting to get married on the track "Lover", as well as the Midnights songs "Midnight Rain" and "Lavender Haze."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Publicist Addresses Allegation She Married Joe Alwyn In Secret ">Taylor Swift’s Publicist Addresses Allegation She Married Joe Alwyn In Secret</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>According to DeuxMoi, Taylor and Joe married in secret before their shocking split earlier this year.</p><p>Rumors of Swift and Alwyn getting married date back to 2019, though they reached a fever pitch in 2022. There were reports that the couple got engaged "behind closed doors" and ensured that their friends and family were "sworn to secrecy," according to The Sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/this-taylor-swift-song-may-have-predicted-her-breakup-with-joe-alwyn-two-years-before-it-happened-front-back-_deposit.jpg><p>There was no evidence to support the claim, but Alwyn's response to the notion of marriage during a Wall Street Journal interview led some fans to believe that he was reluctant. Hence, the heartbroken lyrics. "I mean, if the answer was yes, I wouldn't say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say," the actor told the outlet.</p><h2 id=joe-alwyn-was-reportedly-39-embarrassed-39-by-the-taylor-swift-song>Joe Alwyn Was Reportedly 'Embarrassed' By The Taylor Swift Song</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/joe-alwyn-premiere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor is arguably best known for the songs she's written about her ex-boyfriends.

Something she was reportedly unable to do with Joe Alwyn.</p><p>The source also alluded to Swift's romance with Travis Kelce, claiming that Alwyn is irate over the fact that he's made out to be the villain, while Swift gets championed for "moving on" from the actor. "She’s flaunting this tacky new romance," they added. "The hypocrisy and sheer rudeness of it all is off the charts."</p><p>Neither Swift nor Alwyn have spoken about "You're Losing Me" publicly.
